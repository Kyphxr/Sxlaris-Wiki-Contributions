+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-x104 is [DATA EXPUNGED] and therefore, containment is considered effectively impossible. In the event that SCP-x104 is brought into containment, she should immediately be dosed with the highest level tranquilizers and amnestics available, after which she should be placed in [DATA EXPUNGED] in wing B of [[[SCP-x184]]] at Site-814. 

+++++ Description: 
SCP-x104 is a former human (Homo sapiens) female, known as Ashley Monroe. Born as a non-anomalous human, at some point in time, Ashley came into contact with [[[SCP-x014]]] at which point she was transformed into SCP-x104. 

SCP-x104 refers to herself as the personification of death, and is capable of taking on several forms designated SCP-x104-1 through SCP-x104-3.

SCP-x104-1 looks like an average human woman, with the only anomalous property being the orange hue of her skin, and what appears to be skeletal face paint marked on her face and lips. SCP-x104-1 is most often seen wearing a cloak and cowl, and can pass as an ordinary human.

Her SCP-x104-2 form is nearly identical, with purple [data expunged] manifesting around her arms and legs, acting as a sort of armor. Black tattoos appear on her body, swirling with eldritch runes, and enabling her access to [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-x104-3 has the body of a human woman, but a face that appears to be a skull surrounded in purple and blue flames. Black arms manifest seemingly out of nowhere and wrap around her, these hands can be detached and controlled at will and are capable of acting independently from SCP-x104, allowing her to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.  SCP-x104 is able to manifest constructs of pink light, often using it to adorn herself with armor.
