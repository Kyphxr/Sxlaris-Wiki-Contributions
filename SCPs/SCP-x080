+++++ Description: 
SCP-x080, commonly referred to as Zentrite, is a nearly indestructible metal alloy derived from [DATA EXPUNGED]. Created by the ATLYS Corporation in 19██, Zentrite is a highly sought after raw material used for robotics, automatons, s███████s, and other vehicles due to its impossible durability. 

This combined with the fact that only a handful of people know the process of creating SCP-x080, and even fewer have the resources to do so, SCP-x080 is an astronomically expensive resource.
