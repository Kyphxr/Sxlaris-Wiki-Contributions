**Special Containment Procedures:**
Instances of SCP-x052 are to be kept in a reinforced containment chamber measuring 10m x 10m x 5m, constructed from a non-orgnic, low-friction alloy to prevent climbing. 

**Description:**
Instances of SCP-x052 are abnormally large spiders, that appear to be grafted out of the fingers of multiple giant hands. Ranging from 1-3 m tall, instances of SCP-x052 are known to be exceptionally hostile, using their finger like appendages to grab and crush their prey.
