**Special Containment Procedures:**
Instances of SCP-x052 are to be kept in a reinforced containment chamber measuring 10m x 10m x 5m, constructed from a non-organic, low-friction alloy to prevent climbing. The chamber is to be inspected on a monthly basis by assigned D-Class personnel for signs of wear.

**Description:**
SCP-x052 refers to a group of anomalous organisms resembling enormous spiders made from gigantic fingers. Instances of SCP-x052 exhibit highly predatory behavior, using their finger-like appendages to skitter across surfaces with unnatural agility.

Despite the lack of visual organs, SCP-x052 exhibits awareness of its surroundings, reacting to movement, sound, and other environmental stimuli. The entities possess inhuman strength, using their appendages to grab and crush their prey with ease.
