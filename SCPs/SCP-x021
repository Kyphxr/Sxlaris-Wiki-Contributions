SCP-x021 is a sub species of Homo sapiens, designated Homo sapiens lupus. Instances of SCP-x021 are indistinguishable from baseline humans under normal conditions, however, they possess the anomalous ability to shapeshift into a form of wolf. 

In their adolescence, instances of SCP-x021 seem to have no control over this anomalous transformation, with them forcibly changing on nights of the full moon. However, older instances seem to have a complete level of control over this ability, shifting back and forth between forms at will. 

While in human form, SCP-x021 displays slightly enhanced strength and hearing, estimated to be about double what would be expected of an ordinary Homo sapiens at the same muscle mass and bone density.
