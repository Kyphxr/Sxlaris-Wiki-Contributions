+++++ Description: 
Instances of SCP-x021 are an offshoot of the species of Homo sapiens, designated Homo lupus. Instances of SCP-x021 are indistinguishable from baseline humans under normal conditions, however, they possess the anomalous ability to shapeshift into a form of wolf. 

In their adolescence, instances of SCP-x021 seem to have no control over this anomalous transformation, with them forcibly changing on nights of the full moon. However, older instances seem to have a complete level of control over this ability, shifting back and forth between forms at will. 

While in human form, SCP-x021 displays slightly enhanced strength and hearing, estimated to be about double what would be expected of an ordinary Homo sapiens at the same muscle mass and bone density. 

In their lupine form, SCP-x021 displays strength and speed far exceeding that of any ordinary wolf. At full maturity, the wolf form of SCP-x021 can reach up to 4 meters in length and have a maximum bite force of 10,000 PSI.
