SCP-x021 is a sub species of Homo sapiens, designated Homo sapiens lupus. Instances of SCP-x021 are indistinguishable from baseline humans under normal conditions, however, they possess the anomalous ability to shapeshift into a form of wolf. 

Young instances of SCP-x021 seem to have no control over this anomalous transformation, with them forcibly changing on nights of the full moon. However, older instances seem to have a complete level of control over this ability, shifting back and forth between forms at will.
