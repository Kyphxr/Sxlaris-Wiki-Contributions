+++++ Description: 
SCP-x067 is a species of tall, bipedal humanoids with smooth, leathery skin. Typically, their skin color is a bright yellow, although other color variants have been documented on rare occasions. Notable sightings include red, blue, green, and white instances of SCP-x067. One detail that remains consistent across all variations, however, is a carved smiley face smeared with blood that perfectly matches the grin of a Phobic Centipede.

SCP-x067 entities are predominantly humanoid, with their legs possessing a thick, blocky shape. The chest area is shielded by a subtle carapace. They have long, noodle-like arms that end in sucker mouths full of hooked teeth that latch onto prey, turning them into an instance of SCP-x067.
