+++++ Description: 
SCP-x012, is a reclusive, deer-like species of entities native to the Ashlands. Although they resemble ordinary cervid, Emberstags are clearly recognizable by their dark brown to pitch black fur, glass antlers, and orange hooves. 

Their hooves glow a searing orange as if fresh from a forge, each step melting the ash beneath their feet, leaving a trail of partially formed crying obsidian behind them. These smooth, obsidian-like impressions allow for hunters to track Enderstags for hundreds of meters across the ashy wasteland, though their fur can still make them difficult to spot.
