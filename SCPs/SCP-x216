+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
The entrance to SCP-x216 is to be housed within a its designated high-security containment cell in [[[SCP-x184]]]. Access to SCP-x216 requires Level 4-x216 clearance and direct authorization from the O5 Council. The entrance to SCP-x216's containment unit is sealed by a reinforced, memetically-shielded vault door.

Testing with SCP-x216 is strictly prohibited outside of O5-approved operations at risk of termination.
 
Any unauthorized dimensional disruptions caused by SCP-x216-3 must be immediately suppressed through deployment of Task Force Omega-7, equipped with reality stabilization devices and Class A amnestics.

+++++ Description:
 SCP-x216 is broken up into 4 distinct subclasses, designated SCP-x216-1 through SCP-x216-4.

--**SCP-x216-1** is an apparently infinite extradimensional space composed solely of an unbroken expanse of solid concrete flooring, extending in all directions with no discernible edges, walls, or features that will hereby be referred to as the "labyrinth". The space is entirely devoid of light sources, yet remains consistently lit with a dim purple glow. The space is completely barren, except for a solitary tower rising from its center, stretching endlessly into the void above.-- SCP-x216-1 has been identified as being a part of [SCP-x002] and thus has been recategorized as SCP-x002-GRAY.

**SCP-x216-2** is an elevator that ascends and descends the tower at the center of the labyrinth. It operates by inserting a viable fuel source into a compartment labeled "Core" at the back of the elevator. However, ascending requires approximately 15 times more energy per floor than descending.

**SCP-x216-3** is  a wooden door and doorframe that is completely white that will hereby be referred to as the "entrance". Whenever the entrance is in its dormant state, the knob is unable to be turned and the door is unable to be opened. However, when the entrance is bolted to a surface of any kind, provided it is at least the same height as the frame, the door will open to the concrete expanse of the labyrinth from the wall of the tower opposite the elevator doors.

**SCPx-216-4** describes a pair of orange gemstones that  measure 10cm in width and 15cm in length (referred to as shifters). When these two shifters are impacted against one another, the immediate area surrounding the point of impact is forcibly transported to within the labyrinth. Typically the displaced geography measures about 5km in radius however, this volume seems to increase exponentially if the geographical location is itself anomalous.

Each subsequent activation of the batteries will create a new "layer" that is displaced below the original geography starting from the barren cement wasteland. As new layers are added to the labyrinth, the floor selection in the elevator anomalously updates to include the new space.

+++++ Addendum x216-1:
**All documented levels of the Labyrinth:**
- The Concrete Expanse
- [[[SCP-x002]]] - The Backrooms
- [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3008 SCP-3008-1] - The Infinite Ikea
- [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6111 SCP-6111-1] - The Hidden Forest
- [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7034 SCP-7034] - The Endless Highway
- [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-970 SCP-970] - The Looping Hallway
- [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-860 SCP-860-1] - The Misty Blue Forest

+++++ Addendum x216-2:
**minor geographies of the Labyrinth:**
Certain anomalies fail to adhere to the standard "layering" method of SCP-x216, usually because their very nature makes this form of indexing impossible.

-[[[SCP-x002-Blue]]] - The Blue Channel
