+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
The entrance to SCP-x216 is to be housed within a high-security containment wing at Site-814. Access to SCP-x216 requires Level 4 clearance and direct authorization from the O5 Council. The entrance to SCP-x216 is sealed by a reinforced, memetically-shielded vault door.
 
All instances of SCP-x216-1 (gemstones produced by SCP-x216) are to be cataloged, stored in separate anomalous item lockers, and monitored to prevent unauthorized use. Testing with SCP-x216-1 is strictly prohibited outside of O5-approved operations.
 
SCP-x216-2 (the elevator) is to be actively monitored by a dedicated research and security team. No personnel may activate SCP-x216-2 without authorization and adherence to trans-dimensional navigation protocols.
 
Any unauthorized dimensional disruptions caused by SCP-x216-1 must be immediately suppressed through deployment of Task Force Omega-7, equipped with reality stabilization devices.

+++++ Description:
 SCP-x216 is broken up into 4 distinct subclasses, designated SCP-x216-1 through SCP-x216-4.

SCP-x216-1 is  a wooden door and doorframe that is completely white that will hereby be referred to as the "entrance". Whenever the entrance is in its dormant state, the knob is unable to be turned and the door is unable to be opened. However, when the entrance is bolted to a surface of any kind, provided it is at least the same height as the frame, the door will open to the location of the anchor.

SCP-x216-2 is a green ovular gemstone roughly 10 cm wide and 14 cm long that will hereby be referred to as the "anchor". 

SCPx-216-3 describes a pair of orange gemstones of the same size as the anchor (referred to as the batteries). When these two batteries are impacted against one another, the immediate area surrounding the user is forcibly transported to the location of the anchor. Typically the displaced geography measures about 5km in radius however, this volume seems to increase exponentially if the geographical location is itself anomalous.
