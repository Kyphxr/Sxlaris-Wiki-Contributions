+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
The entrance to SCP-x216 is to be housed within a its designated high-security containment cell in [[[SCP-x184]]]. Access to SCP-x216 requires Level 4-x216 clearance and direct authorization from the O5 Council. The entrance to SCP-x216's containment unit is sealed by a reinforced, memetically-shielded vault door.

Testing with SCP-x216 is strictly prohibited outside of O5-approved operations at risk of termination.
 
Any unauthorized dimensional disruptions caused by SCP-x216-3 must be immediately suppressed through deployment of Task Force Omega-7, equipped with reality stabilization devices and Class A amnestics.

+++++ Description:
 SCP-x216 is broken up into 4 distinct subclasses, designated SCP-x216-1 through SCP-x216-4.

**SCP-x216-1** is a seemingly infinite dimension, completely devoid of anything except a cement floor, that will hereby be referred to as the "anchor". 

**SCP-x216-2** is  a wooden door and doorframe that is completely white that will hereby be referred to as the "entrance". Whenever the entrance is in its dormant state, the knob is unable to be turned and the door is unable to be opened. However, when the entrance is bolted to a surface of any kind, provided it is at least the same height as the frame, the door will open to the location of the anchor.

**SCPx-216-3** describes a pair of orange gemstones of the same size as the anchor (referred to as the batteries). When these two batteries are impacted against one another, the immediate area surrounding the user is forcibly transported to the location of the anchor. Typically the displaced geography measures about 5km in radius however, this volume seems to increase exponentially if the geographical location is itself anomalous.

Assuming the anchor is not moved from its original position, each subsequent activation of the batteries will create a new "layer" that is displaced below the original geography.
