+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
The entrance to SCP-x216 is to be housed within a high-security containment wing at Site-814. Access to SCP-x216 requires Level 4 clearance and direct authorization from the O5 Council. The entrance to SCP-x216 is sealed by a reinforced, memetically-shielded vault door.
 
All instances of SCP-x216-1 (gemstones produced by SCP-x216) are to be cataloged, stored in separate anomalous item lockers, and monitored to prevent unauthorized use. Testing with SCP-x216-1 is strictly prohibited outside of O5-approved operations.
 
SCP-x216-2 (the elevator) is to be actively monitored by a dedicated research and security team. No personnel may activate SCP-x216-2 without authorization and adherence to trans-dimensional navigation protocols.
 
Any unauthorized dimensional disruptions caused by SCP-x216-1 must be immediately suppressed through deployment of Task Force Omega-7, equipped with reality stabilization devices.

+++++ Description:
 SCP-x216 is broken up into 4 distinct subclasses, designated SCP-x216-1 through SCP-x216-4.

SCP-x216-1 is a green ovular gemstone roughly 10 cm wide and 14 cm long that will hereby be referred to as the "anchor". 

SCPx-216-2 describes a pair of orange gemstones of the same size as the anchor. When these two gemstones are impacted against one another, the dimension surrounding the user (typically up to 5 kilometers in radius, but sometimes much larger) is forcibly transported to the location of the anchor.
