+++++ Description: 
Developed in the late 2010's by Dr. Alek █████, SCP-x079, commonly referred to as Serum S-14 was developed by the Shigaraki Corporation in response to the ATLAS Corporation's development of Glimmer. While both substances produce comparable outcomes, Serum S-14 directly mutates the organic material of the subject, imbuing it with anomalous capabilities rather than enhancing already present traits.

Due to these factors, S-14 poses little threat of addiction or side effects caused through prolonged use, as the compound only needs to be administered once to achieve the desired results.
