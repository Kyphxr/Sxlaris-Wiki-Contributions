+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-x001 is contained within the remnants of the ATLYS Corporation Zeta-09 Facility, now designated Site-173-ARC. A 5-kilometer exclusion zone surrounds the containment area, monitored by automated drones and long-range surveillance systems. Personnel assigned to SCP-x001 must undergo weekly psychological evaluations due to prolonged exposure to its hive-mind effects.
 
The central hive structure of SCP-x001 is to remain under continuous observation. Entry into active zones is strictly prohibited without authorization from 2 members of the Overseer Council. Any personnel approaching SCP-x001's hive are required to undergo biometric verification. Visual or auditory identification is no longer deemed reliable due to SCP-x001-A mimetic abilities.
 
Containment protocols have been updated to include automated flame-based sterilization systems and electromagnetic suppression fields to prevent SCP-x001's expansion or creation of SCP-x001-A or SCP-x001-B instances. Any breach scenarios must be met with immediate deployment of Mobile Task Forces Epsilon-7 ("Forget-Me-Nots") and Zeta-9 ("Mole Rats").
