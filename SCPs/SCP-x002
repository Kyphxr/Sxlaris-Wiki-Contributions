+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
 SCP-x002 is currently contained within [[[SCP-x216]]], with its stable entry points and interactions with the external world strictly regulated. The Foundation has established a series of containment protocols to ensure that no unauthorized personnel can access SCP-x002, and that its use remains under strict supervision for both research and containment purposes.
 
It should be noted that various entry points to SCP-x002 open and close at random across spacetime. While The Foundation maintains strict control over all stable entry points, these destabilized entrances are nearly impossible to monitor.

+++++ Description:
 SCP-x002, also known as "The Backrooms," is an anomalous non-Euclidean space that exists as an infinite series of floors, each varying in size, environmental conditions, and the nature of its inhabitants. The structure of SCP-x002 appears to be an infinite complex of yellow-tinted rooms, long hallways, and open spaces. The backrooms are notorious for their disorienting properties, including constant buzzing fluorescent lights, musty carpet floors, and walls made of a material resembling old wallpaper.
 
SCP-x002 is accessed primarily through anomalies located in various places within the Foundation’s research sites. Once entered, individuals are transported to an unknown floor of the complex. The structure of SCP-x002 defies conventional laws of physics, with each floor having unique properties. These floors are categorized as SCP-x002-0, SCP-x002-1, and so on.
