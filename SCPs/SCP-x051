+++++ Description: 
SCP-x051 refers to small artifacts of crystal and metal that grant access to dimensional pockets ideal for portable storage by wanderers. While similar in application to ████ ██ ███████, **Pockets** differ greatly in form and function. SCP-x051 most frequently takes the appearance of jewelry such as rings, earrings, bracelets, and necklaces.  An amorphous material such as amber, opal, or obsidian is almost always present on the object, and is known colloquially as the //pocketstone//.
