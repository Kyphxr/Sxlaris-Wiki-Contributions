+ Special Containment Procedures:
Due to its sheer size, containment of SCP-x137 is currently impossible. Foundation satellites are tasked with monitoring its drift, and Mobile Task Force Mu-9 ("Sky Reapers") is deployed to prevent unauthorized encounters. Civilian aircraft and naval vessels that stray into SCP-x137's territory must be diverted under the guise of extreme weather warnings.

In the event that SCP-x137 descends below 3,000 meters in altitude, immediate suppression efforts using high-yield incendiary ordinance are to be enacted to prevent potential catastrophic interactions with human settlements.

+ Description:
SCP-x137 refers to a massive, leviathan-class aerial organism measuring approximately 120 meters in diameter. Its body consists of a dense, organic mass resembling petrified wood, covered in thick layers of moss and symbiotic plant-like growths. The entity lacks winged appendages or propulsion systems, yet remains buoyant in Earth's atmosphere, moving via slow, undulating contractions of its massive body. SCP-x137 is capable of remaining airborne indefinitely, only descending under conditions not yet fully understood.

SCP-x137 has 8 tendril like appendages that hang down from its central mass: 2 of which act as upper lips for its large oral cavity located on its abdomen below its eyes. When agitated or threatened, SCP-x137 has demonstrated the ability to release highly pressurized bursts of methane-like gas, igniting upon exposure to oxygen, producing destructive firestorms in midair. This behavior has resulted in numerous aircraft disappearances, initially attributed to spontaneous explosions or lightning strikes.
