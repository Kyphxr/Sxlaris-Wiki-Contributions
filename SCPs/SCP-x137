+ Special Containment Procedures:
Due to its sheer size, containment of SCP-x137 is currently impossible. Foundation satellites are tasked with monitoring its drift, and Mobile Task Force Mu-9 ("Sky Reapers") is deployed to prevent unauthorized encounters. Civilian aircraft and naval vessels that stray into SCP-x137's territory must be diverted.

+ Description:
SCP-x137 is a massive, leviathan-class aerial organism measuring approximately 100 meters in diameter. Its body consists of a dense, organic mass resembling petrified wood, covered in thick layers of moss and symbiotic plant-like growths.
