+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
Instances of SCP-x057 are to be kept in 10 m x 10 m x 3 m containment cells, the inner lining of which should be constructed from 25 cm thick ceramic tiles, enclosed with a 1 m thick layer of stainless steel. The interior of these spaces are to have no less than 6 light sources on at all times, pointing from each direction, and preventing the creation of any shadow.

Instances of SCP-x057 are to be fed 35 kg of raw meat, per day.

+++++ Description: 
SCP-x057 is a large species of canines that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with long black fur, and bright orange eyes. Instances of SCP-x057 can vary in size and appearance, with some having brown or white fur, rather than the typical black. 

Instances of SCP-x057 are able to teleport short distances through use of shadows, traveling directly into one shadow, and out of another. SCP-x057 instances are impervious to fire, and have five (4) glowing, retractable claws on each of their front paws, which burn at an estimated 315° C.
