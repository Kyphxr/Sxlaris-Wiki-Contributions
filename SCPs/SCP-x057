+++++ Description: 
SCP-x057 is a large species of canines that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with long black fur, and bright orange eyes. Instances of SCP-x057 can vary in size and appearance, with some having brown or white fur, rather than the typical black. 

Instances of SCP-x057 are able to teleport short distances through use of shadows, traveling directly into one shadow, and out of another. SCP-x057 instances are impervious to fire, and have five (4) glowing, retractable claws on each of their front paws, which burn at an estimated 315° C.
