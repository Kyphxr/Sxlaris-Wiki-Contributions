+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
Due to its expansive nature and the involvement of [url:https://www.worldanvil.com/w/sxlaris-sxlar-wasteland/a/the-knights-templar-article]GoI-004 ("The Knights Templar")[/url], direct containment of SCP-x666 is currently unfeasible. Foundation efforts are focused on monitoring known entry points and minimizing civilian exposure through misinformation, surveillance, and localized containment zones. The primary entry point, designated SCP-x666-A ("The Maw"), located on the northeastern border of Kazakhstan, is encircled by a perimeter maintained under the guise of a hazardous materials exclusion zone.

Foundation operatives embedded within GoI-004 report sporadic activity and attempts by the group to manipulate the anomalies within SCP-x666 for their own purposes. Diplomatic efforts to gain partial control or intelligence about SCP-x666 continue under strict oversight from the O5 Council.

Foundation-approved exploration of SCP-x666 is limited to D-Class personnel with specialized equipment and is overseen remotely. All expeditions must be approved by at least two Level-4 personnel. Survivors of SCP-x666 incursions are to be quarantined and subjected to extensive psychological and medical evaluations.
