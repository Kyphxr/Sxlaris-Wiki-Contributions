+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
Due to its expansive nature and the involvement of GoI-004 ("The Knights Templar"), direct containment of SCP-x666 is currently unfeasible. Foundation efforts are focused on monitoring known entry points and minimizing civilian exposure through misinformation, surveillance, and localized containment zones. The primary entry point, designated SCP-x666-A ("The Maw"), located on the northeastern border of Kazakhstan, is encircled by a perimeter maintained under the guise of a hazardous materials exclusion zone.

Foundation operatives embedded within GoI-004 report sporadic activity and attempts by the group to manipulate the anomalies within SCP-x666 for their own purposes. Diplomatic efforts to gain partial control or intelligence about SCP-x666 continue under strict oversight from the O5 Council.

Foundation-approved exploration of SCP-x666 is limited to D-Class personnel with specialized equipment and is overseen remotely. All expeditions must be approved by at least two Level-4 personnel. Survivors of SCP-x666 incursions are to be quarantined and subjected to extensive psychological and medical evaluations.

+++++ Description:
SCP-x666, referred to as "Tartarus," is a sprawling extradimensional anomaly that manifests as an underground dungeon-like complex accessible through various entry points scattered across the globe. Each known entry point appears to be a fixed gateway to SCP-x666, with "The Maw" in northeastern Kazakhstan serving as the largest and most stable access site, spanning an underground diameter of approximately 50 miles.

Internally, SCP-x666 consists of an infinite series of labyrinthine levels, each characterized by distinct environmental hazards, anomalous entities, and a pervasive psychological effect described as escalating dread and paranoia. The deeper one ventures into SCP-x666, the more hostile and bizarre the conditions become, with higher levels resembling primitive ruins while lower levels appear as alien, biomechanical structures. Survivors report that environmental conditions and the behavior of entities within SCP-x666 seem tailored to exploit the deepest fears and psychological vulnerabilities of those who enter.

Entities encountered within SCP-x666, collectively designated SCP-x666-1, range from humanoid figures to grotesque amalgamations of organic and inorganic materials. SCP-x666-1 entities often exhibit extreme hostility, with some demonstrating rudimentary intelligence and the ability to manipulate their surroundings. Reports from deeper levels suggest the presence of SCP-x666-1 entities with godlike capabilities, including the apparent power to alter memories and perceptions of intruders.
