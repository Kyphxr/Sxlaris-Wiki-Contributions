+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
Instances of SCP-x005 are to be contained in standard human containment cells, especially those with additional anomalous traits.

+++++ Description: 
SCP-x005 is a human woman named Katelyn Connors who was the victim of incident [[[CYA-009-19]]] on [DATA EXPUNGED] in which [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2000 SCP-2000] was activated by [DATA EXPUNGED] and began creating copies of Ms. Connors. 

SCP-x005 instances can vary wildly in form, due to [DATA EXPUNGED] during the incident. Most instances of SCP-x005 resemble the original Katelyn Connors, with pale skin, blonde hair, and green eyes. While most instances of SCP-x005 are non-anomalous in nature, outside of being exact replicas of the original SCP-x005, many instances do, although a majority of these anomalies are reserved to physical appearances, such as animal-human hybrids, various non-human skin colors, and the appearance of auxiliary body parts such as gills, antennae, or teeth.
