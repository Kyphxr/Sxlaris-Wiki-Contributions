+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
While SCP-x100 cannot be contained with traditional means, methods of access to SCP-x100 are effectively impossible for any person to access. The exception is entrance 8b, which is located in the basement of the ███ Nightclub in Las Vegas, Nevada. This entrance has been sealed shut and covered.

+++++ Description: 
SCP-x100 is a pocket dimension holding an impossibly large ash tree that acts as a nexus point between what seems to be various extra-dimensional realms. SCP-x100 is home to several instances of [[[SCP-x030]]] as well as several other anomalies, and as such, can be rather precarious to traverse.

Some branchs of SCP-x100 end in a sort of portal that lead to various realms, these realms being designated SCP-x100-1 through SCP-x100-██.

List of Documented Branches:
* SCP-x100-1, designated Olympus, is the home of [[[SCP-x007]]].
* SCP-x100-2, the Mandjet, is the home of [[[SCP-x023]]].
* SCP-x100-3, Asgard is the uppermost point of SCP-x100 and is the home of [[[SCP-x030]]].
