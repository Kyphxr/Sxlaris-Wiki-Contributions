Scp-x015 appears to be a disembodied human finger that is approximately 218 cm in length, and has a diameter of 30 cm. The skin of the finger has a blue hue, and the proximal phalange bone extends out of the bottom of the finger about 35 cm. 

When held by the protruding bone and swung like a hammer the finger will produce a flicking motion with an exceeding amount of force.
