+++++ Description: 
SCP-x019 is a genetic evolution of Homo sapiens, designated Homo anomalia, that possess varying levels of anomalous abilities, sometimes referred to as quirks, or abnormalities. Because instances of SCP-x019 vary so greatly in both scale, power, and risk, most instances are categorized under their own unique Item Number.

Instances of SCP-x019 differ from Humans (Homo sapiens) in that they are born with anomalous traits, rather than those traits being given to them at some point later. However, it is worth noting there have been instances of H. sapiens being mutated into H. anomalia, however this process involves a full rewriting of the individuals genetic code and can usually only be accomplished by a Type Green[[footnote]]  "Type Green" is a designation of the Human Anomaly Classification System found [[[human-anomaly-classification|here]]].  Type Green is the highest level out of 5.[[/footnote]] reality bender.
