+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-x9237 is to be stored in a high-security anomalous artifacts vault at Site-███, equipped with ontokinetic dampeners to mitigate potential dimensional interference. Access is restricted to Level 4 personnel or higher, with direct experimentation requiring approval from the Site Director and oversight by the Thaumaturgic Phenomena Division.

SCP-x9237-4, designated as a Class-IV Ontological Entity, is currently uncontained. Due to SCP-x9237-4’s ability to traverse parallel realities, security personnel are instructed to monitor for any unexplained shifts in baseline reality associated with its movements.

+++++ Description:
SCP-x9237 is a black VHS camcorder, externally consistent with early 1990s consumer models. The device exhibits no physical abnormalities but displays a unique ontological imprint, suggesting an ability to interact with parallel dimensions. The camera’s anomalous effects manifest when it is used to record an event of significant personal or metaphysical importance, such as birth, death, or existential trauma.

When activated, SCP-x9237 splits the recorded subject into two distinct entities, one of which becomes trapped in an adjacent, parallel reality. The existence of this second entity remains dependent on SCP-x9237’s function, preventing full reintegration unless a secondary anomalous event occurs.

**SCP-x9237-4:**
SCP-x9237-4, Annie █████, is a former human subject whose was given anomalous abilities via SCP-x9237’s effects. At birth, Annie was recorded using SCP-x9237 by her mother, a member of the Serpent’s Hand, who sought to create an anomaly for [DATA EXPUNGED]. The recording caused a fracture in Annie’s being, splitting her across two realities—one version remained in baseline reality, while the other was trapped within an alternate dimension accessible only through SCP-x9237.

After decades of separation, Annie’s two halves merged when SCP-x9237-4 made direct physical contact with her lost counterpart, allowing her to freely shift between dimensions at will. This process appears irreversible, making SCP-x9237-4 the only known entity to have survived reintegration after SCP-x9237’s use.
