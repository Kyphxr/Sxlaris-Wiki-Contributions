+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-x9237 is to be stored in a high-security anomalous artifacts vault at Site-███, equipped with ontokinetic dampeners to mitigate potential dimensional interference. Access is restricted to Level 4 personnel or higher, with direct experimentation requiring approval from the Site Director and oversight by the Thaumaturgic Phenomena Division.

SCP-x9237-4, designated as a Class-IV Ontological Entity, is currently uncontained. Due to SCP-x9237-4’s ability to traverse parallel realities, security personnel are instructed to monitor for any unexplained shifts in baseline reality associated with its movements.

+++++ Description:
SCP-x9237 is a black, mid-1990s camcorder of unknown make and model, displaying minor signs of wear and tear. Despite lacking any identifying serial numbers or branding, the device appears functional, capable of recording and playing back footage through an integrated display.

When activated, SCP-x9237 exhibits a primary anomalous effect: any individual viewed through its lens appears as a subjectively altered version of themselves, often reflecting deep-seated fears, insecurities, or repressed memories. The alterations are not uniform, varying significantly between individuals. In some cases, subjects report perceiving themselves as physically altered, whereas others witness manifestations of past trauma or disturbing distortions.

In addition, SCP-x9237 possesses an affective influence: individuals who view themselves through the playback function often experience lingering psychological distress, including heightened paranoia, dissociation, or—in extreme cases—hallucinatory episodes. Testing suggests that repeated exposure may permanently alter self-perception, causing subjects to believe they have always looked or behaved as seen in the footage.
