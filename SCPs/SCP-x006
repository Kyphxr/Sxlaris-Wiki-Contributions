+++++ Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-x006 sites are to be quarantined off until all SCP-x006 residue is removed. Any amount of SCP-x006 found in a site is to be collected into storage containers (preferably glass jars, or liquid sealed metal containers) and moved to Site-814[[footnote]][[span style="color: purple;"]]why do we always get stuck doing this stuff?[[/span]][[/footnote]], where it is to be packaged, and redistributed to the health wings of all Foundation sites.

+++++ Description: 
SCP-x006, often known as moth jelly, is a nutritional, jelly-like substance produced by [[[SCP-x024]]] to feed their young and maintain their hives. It typically takes on a violet coloration and has a similar consistency to maple syrup. Moth Jelly is highly nutritious as it's high in protein, nutrients and natural sugars and it keeps those who consume it fuller longer as well as give them a considerable boost in strength, energy and stamina for the entire day.

[[span style="color: #ebe3a0;"]]Although Moth Jelly is most often found in █████ 5, it seems like the █████ are beginning to [DATA EXPUNGED], making the jelly a little more common. [[/span]]

These qualities make Moth Jelly a very valuable food source for wanderers. It has also been shown to greatly improve one’s mood and rejuvenate one’s drive to survive. Although, as of a new update from an explorer group, if you consume larger doses than recommended within a short time period, it may lead to some adverse health effects and anomalous properties.

Moth jelly is described as being exceptionally sweet and tasting like blueberries and honey with an aftertaste of lavender. It also has an interesting side effect in that it causes male Deathmoths to be attracted to and steadfastly protective of the consumer and causes females to ignore them entirely for about 5-6 minutes, where the effects will then wear off. Users can use this to their advantage to retrieve more Moth Jelly from female Deathmoths without being harmed. This is due to the female [[[SCP-x024]]] pheromones that are present in Moth Jelly, as it causes [[[SCP-x024]]] instancess to believe that the consumer is a Queen.

In spite of all of the positive qualities of Moth Jelly, it is incredibly addictive and exceeding the recommended daily amount (1-2 cups) will cause the user to become hopelessly hooked and desperate for more, even willing to go directly to the source and risk their lives. Side effects of over-consumption also include blurred vision, intense euphoria and uncontrollable giggling, and possible development of teratomas in their systems.
