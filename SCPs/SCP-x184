+++++ Special Containment Procedures: 
SCP-x184 is to be kept on its designated stand at Site-814 at all times. The stand is a 3m tall by 2m wide piece of reinforced cement. SCP-x184 is to remain bolted to this stand at all times. A hydraulic press is mounted to the ceiling above SCP-x184's stand, holding it in place, with a cement extruder mounted behind it. 5 of these structures are assembled on the lowest floor of site-814 the largest housing SCP-814 and the 4 smaller ones holding SCP-x814-01 through -04 respectively. 

In the event of a failsafe trigger, the press will flatten SCP-x814 down to a disc, before quick dry cement is extruded over top. Once the cement has hardened, the stand is lowered 85m into a slot in the floor, which is subsequently filled in its entirety with self setting polymer concrete. The bottom floor of Site 814 is subsequent filled with the same polymer concrete. 

+++++ Description: 
SCP-x184 is a 12x20cm can made from titanium alloy. A rectangular opening has been cut into the side of the can, with a layer of titanium alloy attached to a hinge acting as a small door.
