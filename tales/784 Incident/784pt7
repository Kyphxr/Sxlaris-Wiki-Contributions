+ "Ever Dance With the Devil in the Pale Moonlight?"

"Delta One, in position."

"Delta Two, in position."

"Delta Three, in position."

"Delta Six. Go."

-----
Beatrix Maddox sat on the lakeshore with her shoes off, letting the cool water flow over her bare feet, as she smiled and waited for Andrews to arrive with the picnic basket. He was bringing wine, cheese, and olives, and this delicious bread from the bakery down the street.

Italy was everything that she had ever imagined. The food, the wine, the music, the nights spent with her lover, the days spent exploring the gorgeous Mediterranean countryside. It was everything that Andrews. . . that Andrea. . . had promised and more.

She couldn't have cared if they'd spent the time in a quiet farmhouse in Kansas, or a New York City apartment. For her, all that mattered was that they were together.

It was her last thought before the .22 caliber round hit her between the eyes. She slumped over onto her side, her blood pooling under her, staining the wood dark red.

-----
"Delta One, target neutralized."

"Delta Two, confirm."

"Delta Three, engaging target."

"Delta One, moving to support."

"Negative, Delta One, Delta Three. Delta Six will handle this one personally."

-----
"You fucking bastard," Andrews whispered. He. . . she. . . spat a tooth out, dislodged from where Delta Six had clipped her with the butt of his pistol. "You fucking bastard. You promised."

"I did? I don't recall saying anything of the sort. Only that it wasn't my concern at the time." Delta Six, also known as Assistant Director Clef, smiled. . . he always smiled. . . as he rifled through Maddox's purse, pulling out her wallet, taking the cash, and tossing the rest into the lake. "It is now."

"You fucking bastard! You asshole! We wouldn't have talked! We just wanted. . . we just wanted to be left alone, why couldn't you let us at least have that!"

"Because, my friends, you can't just be left alone." Clef said, calmly. "You were involved. And you can't get uninvolved." He laughed. "I mean, what the hell would our world come to if people could just. . . quit? Who the fuck would keep doing this job? Psychos and assholes, that's who."

"And which are you?" Andrews sneered.

"Me? I'm perfectly sane. So I guess that makes me an asshole." He raised his gun and put the muzzle of the handgun between Andrews' eyes. "I mean, hell, look at me. Perfectly good sniper team, and I've gotta come down here and do it up close. Can't be satisfied just doing it from range, can I? Can't have you just die quietly without knowing what hit you, like I did to your girlfriend. No, I gotta get up close and look into your eyes first."

"I know," Andrews whispered. "I was counting on that."

-----
"Delta One, man down, man down!"

"Delta Two, engaging, engaging!"

"I don't have a clean shot!"

"Fuck!"

-----
"Fucker. Motherfucker. Fucking asshole," Clef gasped. He was holding in his stomach. It wasn't a good sign, the way that his guts were spilling out.

"Like you said, Clef. Only two kinds of people still work here," Andrews said. He raised the bloody nanolathed knife that he'd crafted from the slide of Clef's gun, wiped it calmly off on the sleeve of his. . . of her. . . jacket. "Assholes and Psychos. I didn't used to be either." He smiled as he knelt by Clef's side. "I guess, after killing enough cats, you kinda turn into both."

"Fucker. Motherfucking. . . fucking liar, you said you were gonna nuke the damn nanites. . ."

"I know. I lied. You should know all about that."

"Won't get away with this! You'll be dead before you get two steps!"

"I don't plan to. Because the truth is, Clef, I never wanted to. All I wanted to do is to tell you something. . . to tell you the truth." Andrews leaned down close, and the voice of Director Valentine whispered into Clef's ear.

Clef's face went pale, and he shuddered.

Then Valentine's body stood and turned towards the lake. It extended its arms out and dropped the knife onto the ground. It closed its eyes and smiled as it walked down the dock towards where Beatrix Maddox lay dead on the cold, hard wood.

The sniper's bullet pierced its skull just as it reached her, and it slumped down on top of her, arms outstretched, their two bodies laying on top of each other like two lovers embracing in their sleep.

-----

As Clef was loaded into evac, a pair of eyes watched from the tree line, 30 meters from the motionless bodies of Andrews and Maddox. Once the helicopter took off, a figure stood up, and quietly approached the dock.

Delta One turned around just in time to watch Delta Three's body instantly triple in size; growing into a horrific, misshapen lump of flesh, an awful scream gurgling out of what used to be a mouth. 

"What the fu-" Delta One began to yell out before a rock slammed into his throat. He fell to his knees. He looked up at the man approaching him, a tall, lean man with glowing blue eyes. The world went dark as the man swiped his arm and Delta One's neck snapped.

Delta Two began drawing his side arm, but he felt a hand close around his neck before the gun was even out of the holster. His feet left the dock as the man held him out over the water. He could hear his vertebrae begin to pop.

"Resentment is one hell of a drug," the man said, smirking. "and you guys are a magnet for the shit." 

Delta Two felt his body begin to change; he felt heavier, he started sputtering for breath. Even though he could breath, he felt like he was drowning. As the man dropped him into the water he realized he could suddenly breath, as if he had gills. In a panic, Delta Two realized he couldn't move, his body had been misshapen, stretched and bloated into an amorphous blob. A rock with gills.

[[[SCP-x014]]] turned back to the bodies laying on the dock behind him. He walked to the ordinary woman and placed his hand on her forehead. The feeling of absorbing biological matter is a difficult one to understand. Even now, after all these years, the feeling of your biological structure changing was nearly impossible to process. He turned to the other body, the false body. Absorbing her, he could feel the disconnect; a separation of mind and body held together through technology. 

"Interesting," he thought to himself. The memories were what he was after though. //Agent Adrian Andrews//. Scientist, turned soldier, turned biomechanical nightmare. Still, the pureness of the hatred surprised him, not because of how much there was, but more so because of how singular the focus of that hatred was. 

"Dr. Clef," he wondered aloud. A second name to guide his vengeance. "A scientist and a killer," he chuckled to himself "two halves of the guy they just put a bullet in."
