Want to contribute to the SCP Foundation? Well, you've come to the right place!

Before you get started, you'll need to [[[system:join| Join the Site]]]. Make sure you've also read the [[[Guide For Writing]]], which contains important advice on how to write an article and get feedback on it before posting. Before creating a new page, we strongly recommend that you read through that page and follow its advice.

SCP Articles
[[/div]]
[[div class="content-type-description"]]
**SCP Articles** are the heart of the Foundation, short stories in style of technical documents about the various anomalies contained by the Foundation.

[[div class="bridge"]]
[[module ListPages separate="no" limit="1" tags="+hub +metadata" name="scp-series%" order="name desc"]]
To create an SCP, go to the **[[[%%name%%|most recent series]]]** and click on a number with [ACCESS DENIED] next to it.
[[/module]]
You are not allowed to rename your SCP to an empty lower-numbered slot after creation.[[footnote]]Refer to the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/technical-content-policy#toc13 Technical Content Policy].[[/footnote]]
[[/div]]

**[[[scp-ex|Explained SCPs]]]** are about objects or phenomena that are no longer considered anomalous. **[[[Joke SCPs]]]** use the SCP format as the setup for a joke. These are not organised into series, and can be created by typing the intended slot (e.g. SCP-123-J) into the box at the bottom of this page, then adding a link and title to the Explained or Joke SCP list.

Tales, GoI Formats & Others
[[/div]]
[[div class="content-type-description"]]
If SCP Articles are the heart of the Foundation, then **[[[foundation-tales| Tales]]]** are its soul. Tales can be anything from formal reports to narrative short stories to poetry, exploring some aspect of the Foundation, its personnel, or other topics or events within the Foundation universe.

**[[[GoI Formats]]]** are documents written from the perspective of a [[[groups-of-interest| Group of Interest]]], who each approach the anomalous in their own unique way.

You can create a tale, GoI format, or any other type of page by typing in the intended title into the box below. Be careful not to use colons (:), as this will put your page in the wrong category. This only sets the slug,[[footnote]]The part of the URL that comes after the slash, e.g. {{@@https://scpwiki.com/@@**//contribute//**}}[[/footnote]] and you can change the actual title of the page while editing.
