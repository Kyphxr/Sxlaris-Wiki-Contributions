|caption=Main atrium of the courtyard. Note the table in the corner, and the shadowy figures visible through one of the windows.
]]
Level 881 primarily consists of an irregularly-shaped indoor atrium, with a mean diameter of approximately 50 yards (45m) and a height of approximately 33 yards (30m). It is encircled on all sides by austere concrete walls of indeterminate thickness, each painted a stark white color and inlaid with windows at perfectly even intervals.

The level is fully climate-controlled. Its air temperature is maintained with exactitude at 13.8°C (56.84°F), and its relative humidity with precision at 45.2%. It imposes upon the skin a dry itch and frigid chill at all times and without exception.

Under most circumstances, the courtyard is devoid of inhabitants. It is blanketed in a deafening, heavy, ghostly silence.

+ Discovery:
Level 881 was first logged on the General Public Database on 5/2/2009 by an unknown user.[[footnote]]The original entry has been replaced by the page you are currently reading, updated with verified, accurate information.[[/footnote]] In January 2017, M.E.G. Team 'Owl-Eyes' of Regiment Compass Point were sent to document the level. They did not return.

Incomplete logs from Team Owl-Eyes were partially recovered over the next few months by other visitors to the courtyard. However, the records remain incomplete, and the fate of the operatives is unknown.

]]

The courtyard's primary feature is its main atrium. Typical accounts suggest approximately 100 to 200 equally-spaced windows instantiated on its walls at any given moment, most with blinds covering the insides. As a result, the space constitutes the best known example of a [*http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-2 window] entity infestation. Survivor accounts report anywhere from one quarter to almost all ordinary windows in the courtyard as being replaced by their malicious living counterparts.

At the atrium's center lies a paved pentagonal pathway, with four perpendicular inroads leading to a circular patch of pale birchwood flooring in the middle. The timber circle is hollow, though what lies beneath has yet to be ascertained with certainty. Attempts to pry open the wooden planks have been generally unsuccessful.

Samples of greenery between the pathways were provided to the M.E.G. from visitors to the courtyard. Analysis demonstrated that the substance, previously assumed to be artificial turf, is in actuality living organic moss. Following study, the specimens were donated to the Amor Incrementum. The cult responded with exceeding gratitude and reciprocal [*http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-39 gifts]. In particular, the leader of their diplomatic delegation issued the following remark:

Moreover, the atrium is thought to be in a state of perpetual spatial flux. Each documented encounter has described a different initial layout, with structures proceeding to shift while left unobserved. Apart from windows, some iterations of the atrium have also featured glass railings, pillars and elevated connecting walkways between walls. Additionally, a number of household objects may potentially materialize. These include:

[[div class="indent"]]
* A table
* A gramophone
* Old photographs
* Books
* Vases, household ornaments, etc.

__**URGENT UPDATE 7/7/2022:**__
Several of the above fixtures/objects are suspected to be extranormal neuro-auditory/neuro-visual agents (NAAs/NVAs). Prolonged contact may induce nonstandard psychological/neurological effects, which may cause harm to yourself or those around you. If you find yourself trapped within Level 881, strictly avoid:
[[div class="indent"]]
* Approaching any windows apart from your initial entry point. They are not exits.

* Touching the glass railings running through the atrium.

* Touching or stepping into the wooden circle in the atrium's center. It is not a trapdoor. **//It is not an exit.//**

Additionally, if you or anyone around you begins to hear music of any kind, leave the atrium immediately by any means possible.

If egress is not feasible, attempt to isolate yourself from all visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli, as per standard emergency NAA/NVA protocol. Conceal yourself beneath a blanket or other opaque covering, and remain as still as physically possible. Bind a tight cloth around your eyes and ears, lock your arms behind your neck, and sit with your head firmly placed between your knees for 6 to 8 hours.

Dark brown mahogany doors may occasionally appear on the walls of the courtyard, leading into a set of clinical corridors that surround its perimeter. The white, harshly-lit hallways span several floors, adjoined by stairwells, and may lead out into walkways above the atrium if they are present.

As with the atrium, the corridors display a lack of spatial stability. Doorways and stairwells are known to spontaneously appear, vanish, and shift locations. In addition, a majority of doors are locked from the inside. The few rooms which are accessible are entirely vacant -- perfectly blank stark-white concrete squares. They hold nothing of value.

Most significantly, shadowy silhouettes which bear a strong resemblance to window entities are purported to manifest behind corridor corners or in peripheral vision. If encountered, they are to be avoided at all costs.

+ Entrances And Exits:

+++ Entrances
Windows leading into Level 881 have been found on a variety of indoor levels. Upon entry, they generally disappear within 2-3 minutes.

Do not enter these windows. Stay out of Level 881.

+++ Exits
Rumors of 'shortcuts' to [*http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-283 Level 283] and/or [*http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11 Level 11] are completely unsubstantiated. Apart from the initial entry point, vacant windows are believed to lead to [*http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1-5 Level 1.5].

If you inadvertently find yourself in the courtyard, leave immediately through the window from which you entered. **Stay out of Level 881.**
