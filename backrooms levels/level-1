[!-- Then you can add a short introduction. (Note: You may have seen pages with "Level n is the n+1th level of the Backrooms" here, but this has fallen out of fashion due to not being a strong hook.) --]
 

 
+ Description:
SCP-x002-1, the Habitable Zone is an endless warehouse, predominately made up of rooms and hallways with white walls, and hardwood flooring. The rest the level is comprised of open sprawling areas comprised of concrete and rebar. It is common to find crates of supplies scattered throughout Level 1, containing survival essentials like water, almond water, moth jelly, ropes, and more.

Level 1 appears to have an endless supply of power, however lights will turn off intermittently, creating large patches of dark areas. These dark areas are prone to anomalous events, with crates, entities, and even entire rooms seemingly appearing and disappearing at random when completely dark.
