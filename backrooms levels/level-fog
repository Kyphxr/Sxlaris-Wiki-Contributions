+ Description:
SCP-x002-Ω, the Ashlands is a seemingly infinite desert made out of black, volcanic ash. Islands of land can be found dotted throughout the ash desert, each encompassed by a ravine that stretches down seemingly endlessly, and filled with a thick gray fog.


+ Ecology:
The Ashen One is a species of magma wyrm unique to Level Ash. Measuring over 400m long, this enormous creature has dozens of ports along the length of its body that release a gaseous exhaust that is ignited, allowing the wyrm to propel itself forward. The resulting heat vitrifies the surrounding ash into a fulgurite that is typically referred to as crying obsidian.

The wyrm burrows through the ash by a mix of vitrification and vibratory liquification, allowing them to effectively swim through the ashy terrain. Only emerging once they sense vibrations on the surface, the Ashen One is the apex predator of Level Ω.

+++ The Ashen One

In regular reality, phreatic tubes take form when water and sedimentary particles erode cracks between rocks over time — particularly at the horizontal surface between two different mineral beds (known as the "bedding plane"). As they are formed by a constant flow of fluid, phreatic tubes are known for their roughly uniform "eye-shaped" structure, with the cavern ceiling arching upward and the floor arching downward from the bedding plane.

However, due to the effects of nonstandard physics and inconsistent gravity, many phreatic tubes in Level 8 form chaotically. Bedding planes are often not uniform, and not even horizontal. Phreatic tubes may form in oddly slanted directions, and often twist and loop in apparently impossible directions.

+++ Vadose-stage caves

Vadose-stage caves form when the water level in a phreatic tube drops, such that a stream flows only along the floor. In the Frontrooms, the ceiling and walls of a phreatic tube remain unchanged, while the stream continues to erode the floor, forming a depression in the ground known as a vadose trough.

In Level 8, fluctuating gravitational forces mean that vadose troughs do not always form downward. Often, wanderers may find vadose troughs which curve and loop nonsensically, are carved across walls, or even dig 'upwards' against the ceiling. The orientation of troughs can be helpful to wanderers, indicating the general direction of gravity within a vadose-stage cavern — though this is not totally reliable.

[[tab Breakdown chambers]]

+++ Breakdown chambers

Breakdown chambers occur when phreatic or vadose-stage caves grow large enough that they can no longer support their own weight. The curved ceiling crumbles till it forms a flatbed, littering the floor beneath with loose rocky debris. Owing to gravitational extranormalities within Level 8, the boulders from some such collapses never reach the floor.

Level 8 is full of wacky caves and rock formations! Some of the most fascinating of these are floating rocks. Yep, you read that right — 'cause of the weird gravity in Level 8, rocks can sometimes end up suspended in midair! This can range from a couple of floating pebbles to HUGE floating islands, hovering right in the middle of the largest of caverns.

We warn you: no matter how interesting these formations look, **__DO NOT TOUCH THEM__**. Though some larger formations are stable and can support considerable weight, others are flimsy enough that the slightest prod can cause them to come crashing down. These structures may be curious, but you //don't// want to test them out!

[[tab Rock formations]]

+++ Rock formations

Stalactites and stalagmites ordinarily grow top-down and bottom-up respectively. In Level 8, this is not always the case. The distinction in name between stalactites and stalagmites is no longer helpful here, and speleologists studying these formations have taken to collectively terming them "stalagspikes".

In some caverns, clusters of stalagspikes jut chaotically outward from walls at all angles, slanting erratically in every direction. Some are known to loop around, form knots, zigzag wildly, or end in multiple sharp points. Owing to their random size and shape, they act as obstacles to navigation, and pose a serious risk of laceration and impalation.

Rarely, some stalagspike clusters form highly detailed geometric, man-made, or organic shapes — such as octagonal pillars, tulip buds, staplers, or human hands (complete with unique fingerprints). Such spikes have been tested chemically, and results indicate that they are somehow composed entirely of naturally occurring minerals with no discernible difference from surrounding rocks. Traces of prior carving by humans or entities is also absent, and has been ruled out. The process that formed these curious structures remains a mystery.

Stalagspikes and similar rock constructs are recognized as an uncanny wonder unique to Level 8 and its cave systems.
