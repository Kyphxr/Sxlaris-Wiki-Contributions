[!-- Then you can add a short introduction. (Note: You may have seen pages with "Level n is the n+1th level of the Backrooms" here, but this has fallen out of fashion due to not being a strong hook.) --]
 

 
+ Description:
SCP-x002-Ω, the Ashlands is a seemingly infinite desert made out of black, volcanic ash. Islands of land can be found dotted throughout the ash desert, each encompassed by a ravine that stretches down seemingly endlessly, and filled with a thick gray fog.


+ Ecology:
The Ashen One is a species of magma wyrm unique to Level Ash. Measuring over 400m long, these enormous creatures have dozens of ports along the length of their body that release a gaseous exhaust that is ignited, allowing the wyrm to propel itself forward. The resulting heat vitrifies the surrounding ash into a fulgurite that is typically referred to as crying obsidian.

+ Entrances And Exits
[!-- Add any entrances and exits to other levels. --]
