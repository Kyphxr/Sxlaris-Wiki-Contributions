The Foundation has identified a number of locations around the world (and beyond it) that are actively anomalous and support permanent communities. While these places would generally be given an SCP designation and evacuated, in some cases this is not possible, due to practical or political constraints. Although not all Locations of Interest are fully controlled by the Foundation,  containment measures are in place to ensure that the general public remains unaware of their existence or anomalous nature.

An inhabited anomalous location designated as a Nexus permits residents to remain within it, under the supervision of the Foundation or another Group of Interest, since the anomalous properties of a Nexus generally cannot extend beyond its borders. Additionally, the Foundation has permitted the existence of a number of Free Ports, paranormal enclaves and other locations accessible only through anomalous means, within which the concealment and containment of anomalies is unnecessary. These communities are usually self-managed, with observation from the Foundation and local governments to ensure that anomalous phenomena remain within the Free Port. A number of additional Locations of Interest are known to the Foundation at this time, ranging in scale from small towns to entire countries, as well as entire alternate realities accessible from our own.

As shown on the map above, anomalous locations are given one of the following classifications, based on how obvious their anomalous properties are and how likely civilians from outside the Nexus are to encounter them. For more information on Nexus definitions and properties, see [[[nexus-series| this page]]].

Anomalous activity is an integral part of the town. The Foundation must regularly perform cover-ups, and takes measures to prevent visitors, such as removing the settlement from maps of the area. Containment Facilities may be required on a case-by-case basis.

Name derived from castle of Camelot, from the legends of King Arthur.

Hubs of commerce and living, accessible only through anomalous means. These communities are aware of the anomalous, and make use of it in everyday life. These hubs are protected by national or international law, restricting or forbidding Foundation intervention, with law enforcement within the Nexus often performed by its own local government.

Anomalous location connected to one or more alternate realities in addition to our own reality. These may be alternative timelines that diverged from our own at some point in the past, or entire universes operating under different physical laws to our own. These alternate realities are distinct  from so-called "pocket universes", which are also separated from baseline reality, but are significantly smaller in size.

**Area Class:** --##grey|**Ohanna**##-- ##green|**ENTIRE**## (##666|**Crossroads**##)

**Accessible From:** Baseline, Multiverse

**Surveillance Facility:** Outpost-7243

**Description:** The "Prime Universe" or "Nexus-00" designates consensus reality: all that which is observably, measurably extant and compatible with our universe. This includes any other extrauniversal space which is tethered to, or interfaces with, our reality in a coherent fashion. Any region which can successfully be referenced within consensus reality is, itself, an extension of consensus reality, and therefore comprises Nexus-00. Nexus-00 is of course not a single contiguous, continuous physical surface. It incorporates various physically-disconnected locales which are at least informationally-adjacent to consensus reality. However, it has been evidenced to Our Foundation that the manifold of our local universe (Nexus-00-A) also possesses points and/or boundaries of informational discontinuity. These discontinuities are not to be confused with embedded pocket-universes (ie. a black hole's interior), nor [*/scp-3930 regions of non-existence], nor extreme antimemetic influence, nor local breakdown of conventional physics, nor **##green|hazardous nomenclative influence##**; all such regions can still be referenced, however circuitously, within the manifold of Nexus-00.

**Area Class:** --##red|**Dunwich**##-- ##666|**Crossroads**##

**Accessible From:** Baseline, Multiverse

**Description:** This vast extradimensional library allegedly catalogs everything that has ever been written down, containing countless books that cannot be found anywhere else, including many documenting the occult and paranormal. Although the Foundation has been aware of the Library since 1955, it has existed for much longer than that. The Library is also known as the Nexus of Worlds and the Great Library Yggdrasil due to its connection to multiple universes, with a particularly close connection to other anomalous libraries such as [[[SCP-1726]]] and [[[SCP-4001]]]. The Nexus and the books within are maintained and protected by various inhuman entities known as [[[wanderers-library-hub|Librarians]]]. Individuals that harm the Library, its books, or its patrons are punished by transformation into one of these Librarians, serving the Library until they work off their debt. This has been the fate of a number of Foundation personnel during incursions into the Library, and so the Foundation has adopted a more diplomatic approach to this specific location. The Library is reportedly headed by an entity known as [[[divine-dossier#the-serpent| The Serpent]]], and serves as the base of operations for GoI-014 ("[[[serpent-s-hand-hub|The Serpent's Hand]]]").

**Description:** Known as Tír na nÓg by the Tuatha Dé Danann (//Homo sapiens tumuli//), and as Avalon by the Fae (//Homo sapiens sidhe//), Annwn is an island located in an extradimensional space. Nx-02 is populated by an unknown number of spectral entities, and is accessible only to those subject to certain [[[SCP-6916| oneirological triggers]]]. Due to growing animosity between the Foundation and the ruler of Nexus, the Foundation's access to the space has now been revoked. Initially believed to have been created and governed by the Fae, recent evidence collated by the Foundation suggests the Nexus was actually originally under human governance, likely Celtic Britons. At some point, between the Roman invasion of Britain, the area was taken over by the Fae and exiled from baseline reality, becoming Nx-02..

**Accessible From:** 100 km west of Ireland

**Surveillance Facility**: Site-03

**Description:** One of the Five Fae Kingdoms, Known as Tír na nÓg, The Kingdom of Hy Brasil is a magical island nation state located on an island in the Atlantic Ocean, accessible through non-anomalous means only one day every seven years. The Nexus is governed by the Tuatha Dé Danann (//Homo sapiens tumuli//), an anomalous hominid subspecies native to the island, and acts as a neutral ground for many organisations to operate in, including the Foundation, although the Kingdom is also member of the [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition's]]] Council of 108. The island was devastated in 1988 by the arrival of [[[lte-0851-cetus | LTE-0851-Cetus]]] and the subsequent fallout from the GOC's military response.  Both High King Nuada Airgetlám VII and Crown Princess Mór-Ríoghain were killed, and much of the island's surviving population migrated to other Free Ports and paranormal enclaves. The Nexus remains, significantly diminished in power, strength, and population, although reconstruction efforts are ongoing.

**Area Class:** ##green|**EMBLA**##[[footnote]]An anomalous location functions as a esoteric area use to create anomalies.[[/footnote]] (##666|**Crossroads**##)

**Accessible From:** Baseline, Multiverse

**Surveillance Facility:** [[[secure-facilities-locations| Site-01]]]

**Description:** Nx-05 is a large forest located in upstate [REDACTED], nearby Site-01. It is one of the smallest Nexuses on record, being only 8.3 acres of land in total. The area exhibits mild, albeit consistent non-Euclidean activity. This most often manifests in the form of its various hiking paths temporarily being subject to anomalous activity such as going upward endlessly when travelled in a certain direction, but operating normally otherwise. Nx-05 is unique compared to other Nexuses in that no other anomalous phenomena naturally forms in its confines, with all anomalies resulting from it being entirely manmade. Despite its fairly unimpressive features, Nx-05 remains the only location known to the Foundation which can be accurately studied to provide information on how the anomalous as a whole operates; equations derived from this study have provided the basis for the entirety of the Foundation’s understanding of anomalies since the organization's inception.

**Description:** GoI-842 "The Kingdom of Univers'Isle" is an anomalous civilization built on a floating island in an extradimensional reality that otherwise consists of a completely empty sky. The kingdom was founded in the early 18th Century by the inhabitants of Saint-Guérin in Savoy, France, who traveled through cracks in the sky to colonize the landmass. The intervention of the Catholic Church stranded them there, causing the isolated society to develop their own identity as "Isleans". Their paratechnology eventually enabled them create interdimensional portals, resuming contact with the baseline universe, although there is tension between factions that wish for peace, and others that believe that the "Worldians" of Earth should be conquered. The Foundation is collaborating with the peace-seeking Desilist faction to prevent conflict and ensure the Kingdom of Univers'Isle remains concealed.

In 2011, the construction of the Varenne Gate[[footnote]]A massive paratechnological space-stabilizing machine[[/footnote]] by the Global Occult Coalition and the District Zero government, with support from the government of Vietnam, created a stable entrance to District Zero, enabling the community to become more actively involved in the outside anomalous community.

**Description:** One of the many afterlives available to humanity, Irkalla, also known as Ir-Kalla, Irkalia, Kukku, Arali, Kigal, Kur or Erṣetu, a vast, partially extraspatial underground cavern below the Middle East, with a single spiral staircase acting as its entrance. This cavern contains many spirits and demons from the collection of societies that once resided in pre-Islamic Mesopotamia, and is one of a number of locations that have been traditionally described as a hell. Is the ancient Babylonian and Sumerian underworld or Sumerian Netherworld. It was a dark, dreary cavern located deep below the ground, where inhabitants were believed to continue "a shadowy version of life on earth".

Irkalla was host to a large-scale slave revolt and civil war in the latter half of the 20th century, spurred on by competing interests from both America and the Soviet Union. Relations between Irkalla and the United States have eased lately, allowing an embassy and a UIU International Office to be established in its capital, but tensions still remain high. As the Tartarean Realm slowly industrializes and reaches out to the broader occult community, The United States hopes to use it as a pawn in their cold war against the Prince of Darkness, though the current regime is loath to be manipulated.

Accessible via numerous Ways within the Patagonia region of South America. SCP-6623 is a two-tiered city, organised into numerous hub areas. The lower tier is mostly residential areas, consisting of typical 17th-century Spanish architecture as well as small farms. Due to the quantity of farms, most replacing typical plazas within buildings, it is assumed much of this city's food source was gained through subsistence farming. The city's upper-tier largely consists of intact governmental buildings, schools, marketplaces, and libraries, in addition to a large central building. This building appears to be the focal piece of the city, dwarfing all other buildings on the upper tier. Member of The Seven Cities of Gold.

**Description:** Nx-94 designates not a single contiguous area, but instead a series of First Nations reserves along the coast of Lake Huron where culturally-specific anomalous occurrences are common. As these occurrences typically only involve members of the related cultures, and as local populations are low, only nominal monitoring activities organized at Site-43 have been necessary thus far.

**Surveillance Facility:** [[[secure-facilities-locations|Site-50]]]

**Description:** Once known as SCP-6979-1, Mamonokai was a dimensional mirror of Japan, where the Mamono, a type of Yokai entity lived. The Mamono were once formless entities that gained form and names thanks to the folktales of Japan that they inspired, becoming a cycle that fed both the anomalous world of Japan as well as the one in Mamonokai. Following the Meiji Restoration, Mamonokai was invaded and used by the IJAMEA in order to create the Yokai Battalion, the group murdering all opposition and enslaving the remains. Over 90% of Mamonokai’s population was murdered or removed from the area, and the place was left to rot. Following the discovery of the Kuchisake-Onna, Mamonokai was revitalized, and a town was built inside of it for the residence of anomalous entities and the flourishing of an anomalous society that would benefit Site-50 and the Japanese Branch of the Foundation in general, the once destroyed place becoming a Nexus. While some survivors have accepted the move, others still resent the Japanese for crimes committed by the Empire of Japan.

**Location:** Mobile

**Description:** The floating city-state of Wilheim the Free port and paranormal enclave was founded when SCP-6268 and their following, likewise-minded sidhe and similar fae subjects, managed to take control of Wilheim, a massive aerial eigenweapon created by the German Empire between 1912 and 1917. The construction of Wilheim was mainly aided and supervised by the [[[magierakademie-hub|Mages Academy]]] (Magickademia Germanica), and was intended to function as a weather-manipulating mobile station, but, due to several installation errors, never saw actual deployment.

Under the order of SCP-6268, Wilheim was rebuilt as a floating city-state, operating as a self-proclaimed sanctuary for paranormal beings and human subjects affiliated with the anomalous. Following several disputes between SCP-6268, the government of West Germany, the Global Occult Coalition and the Foundation, Wilheim was officially recognized as an allied and independent geopolitical entity in 1977.

**Area Class:** ##purple|**Free Port**##

**Accessible From:** Bevendean Down Nature Reserve, Brighton, BN2 4LA, United Kingdom

**Description:** Located in a particularly overgrown area of the nature reserve, this very unique market must be sought out by only those who know the chant. You must imagine the market, you must imagine the wares, imagine yourself there — and then offer a sacrifice before you make your wish. As you spin into a new world and land, hopefully on your feet, you realise that a crowded, dusty market surrounds you. Some forms might well be human, but many more forms are clearly not even humanoid — and known earth languages were far from the only ones spoken here. Almost whatever you wish for can be found here, in exchange for meat, preferably removed fresh as the hanging blades and cleavers adorning every market stall. And almost every meat you could ever wish for was also available there, with humans being quite the rarity, as they struggled to recall and retain the chant that let them into a place that sold 'Vincent's (slightly used) Vulvas' and 'Pied Piper's Premie Pies'. Brighton, so far, has the only entrance and exit known to the Meat Market, but is unlikely to truly be the only way in and out — so maybe someone else will stumble across the mystical place beyond the veil too, countries away, and the Meat Market will get something new.

**Description:** Named after and accessible from the former Dutch colony in south Manhattan, New Amsterdam is an artificial pocket universe and paranormal enclave established during the Paranormal Renaissance.

While it has since been brought under American jurisdiction by the [[[paralaw|Hoover Mandate]]], New Amsterdam continues to function as an exclusive community for extremely wealthy individuals behind the Veil.

Some of the oldest and most powerful families known as "Veiled Nobility" and "Veiled Royalty" of the Veiled/Anomalous World, hail from or reside in New Amsterdam, where they are perfectly positioned to manipulate mundane and paranormal affairs while still being free to openly indulge in anomalous interests and activities. The main New York offices of [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub| Marshall, Carter & Dark]]] are located in New Amsterdam, and it is suspected that at least one [[[o5-command-dossier|Foundation Overseer]]] maintains a residence in the enclave.

**Accessible From:** United Kingdom, Europe, Otherworld

**Description:** The Kingdom of Avalon know as "New Avalon" One of the Five Fae Kingdoms. Once a thriving hub for Fae societies, the Sixth Occult War and the establishment of the Veil led to the significant weakening of the nomenclative narrative spells that held Avalon together. This eventually led to its full deconceptualization and disappearance from baseline reality in 1907, forcing most of its citizens to seek refuge in Three Portlands, with the help of the British Occult Service. Although in the modern day, Avalon has been gone for over a century, the [[[finding-avalon|influence of its culture can still be seen throughout most of the paranormal world]]], although reconstruction efforts are ongoing.

The destruction of Avalon resulted in a cultural and political cleavage amongst the survivors. The majority of the Sídhe, including the royal family, resettled in the Outer Hebrides and established the realm of New Avalon; however, a sizable population of Sídhe, driven by anti-royal sentiment, refused to settle in New Avalon, with most instead opting to reside in FP-01 (Three Portlands). The royalists in New Avalon are known as the Seelie, while the anti-royalists in Three Portlands call themselves the Unseelie.

The residents of Fernafaun make their homes within nature, utilising thaumaturgy to reshape the earth and plant-life of the island to fit similar purposes to buildings, bridges and lampposts. Residents believe that artifical structures may damage the essence of the island and, with the sole exception of a small coastal area set aside for a permanent Foundation facility, no truly man-made structures exist on the island.

**Description:** Hollowed-out asteroid 8837 London is home to mankind's first extraterrestrial colony. Accessible through Ways linked to England and Canada, this "Other London" was established in the Victorian era, gradually developing into a mining town and penal labor camp. Abandoned by the Allies during the Seventh Occult War, surviving residents organized their own People's Council, which rebelled against the GOC's attempts to retake the station. After seven long years, an agreement was reached and Other London was finally recognized as an autonomous community.

Per the Kitchener Accords of 1953, GOC-affiliated normalcy protection agencies are allowed in Other London, but their enforcement powers are very limited. This makes the colony a popular hiding spot for anahuman refugees, paracriminals, spies and militants — provided that they contribute to the common good somehow. Those who don't are likely to be judged and "made unwelcome" by the community.

Reporting by the Fifth [[[wandsmen-hub|Wandsman]]] of Elysium exposed a Mexican government conspiracy to hire the [[[valravn-corporation-hub|Valravn Corporation]]] to destroy Ireta K'éri and massacre its residents. The Foundation was suspected of involvement in the plot, [[[A Wandsman in the Navel of the Moon| but no evidence was found to support this allegation]]]. Some of the surviving members of the Ireta K'éri community moved to FP-72, the miniature town of [[[SCP-7269|Ireta Sapi]]], although reconstruction efforts are ongoing.

**Area Class:** ##purple|**Open Free Port**## (provisional)

**Accessible From:** Michoacán, Mexico

**Description:** [[[SCP-7269]]] designates as an anomalous 30 x 30 x 30 meter area located near Pátzcuaro, Michoacán. Humans, vertebrate animals, and human-made objects will shrink gradually upon entering the area, and grow back to their original size when exiting it. Taking advantage of this property, Las Viboras, a left-wing guerrilla group with connections to the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|the Serpent's Hand]]], built a miniature town inside the area, as the successor to the recently destroyed paranormal enclave of Ireta K'éri (formerly FP-71).

The existance of the settlment of Ireta Sapi initially raised security concerns, due to it providing a safe haven for anomalous fugitives pursued by both the Foundation and the Mexican government. However, reporting by the [[[wandsmen-hub| Wandsman]]] as well as diffusion of information through FP-99 (The Net) gained Ireta Sapi considerable support from the international anomalous community, including the [[[manna-charitable-foundation-hub|Manna Charitative Foundation]]] and [[[wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub|Wilson's Wildlife Solutions]]], as well as other Free Ports and paranormal enclaves, particularly [[[three-portlands-hub|Three Portlands]]]. Ireta Sapi has been granted provisional Free Port status by the Foundation, allowing it to continue to operate as an autonomous community.

[[f>image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-2815/Adytumsmall.png width="200px"]]

**Location:** Northern Urals, Western Siberia, Russia (Formerly)

**Description:** Adytum[[footnote]] Greek transliteration of the [[[old-adytite-language|Adytite term]]] //Adí-üm//. Not to be confused with adytum, meaning innermost sanctuary.[[/footnote]] was the capital of the ancient //Kalmaktama// Empire (Adi-um Empire), and is believed to have been located in Western Siberia, now part of Russia. The empire was established in 1,800 BCE by a successful rebellion against the [[[daevite-hub|Daevite civilisation]]], lead by a man known as Grand Karcist Ion. For the next 800 years the city flourished as the center of a new civilization, with grand structures built from organic material through the practice of carnomancy. However, after an ancient [[[scp-2406|Occult War]]] between the //Kalmaktama// Empire and various Mediterranean states, incuding the [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub|Mekhanites]]], Adytum disappeared from the baseline reality along with Grand Karcist Ion, resulting in the collapse of the //Kalmaktama// civilization and the dispersal of a Sarkic diaspora throughout the world.

The current location and status of Adytum are unclear. Minimal archeological evidence for its existence has been found, although given the organic nature of Sarkic structures and tools, this is not unexpected. Various Sarkic sects believe that Adytum still exists somewhere in the void outside the universe, and some accounts suggest it may still be accessible. Multiple Proto-Sarkic sources claim that the city was deliberately removed from baseline reality, although it is unclear if this was intended to protect the city from invaders, or to prevent something within the city from entering into our reality. Several neo-Sarkic sects are actively working toward the rediscovery and [[[scp-2480|return of Adytum]]], an event that would represent a severe disruption to normalcy, and is to be prevented at all costs.

Although referred to in the Quran as "Iram of the Pillars", the location of the city was not identified until directions to it were provided by [[[SCP-1867]]], leading to its rediscovery by a Foundation expedition.

The leaders of this expedition, Doctor Robert Aram and Doctor Hedvig Nussbaum, subsequently went rogue, relocating the city through anomalous means to prevent further Foundation access.

**Location:** Wyoming, USA

**Surveillance Facility:** [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-78| Site-78]]]

**Description:** A rural town with an area of only 3.06 square miles, with an estimated population of 300. Foundation interest in Chugwater began when it was discovered that its residents were more likely to accept anomalous activity as a part of baseline normalcy compared to average, leading its local site to adopt a more lenient strategy of containment around Chugwater's many anomalous happenings.

The cause of Chugwater's apparent draw for anomalous entities, features, and parafauna has yet to be determined, and its status as a Nexus is currently pending.

[[f>image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/locations-of-interest/CICP.png width="150px"]]

**Accessible From:** Baseline, Multiverse

**Description:** The Confederate Island Countries of Phantom (CICP) is a federated nation of islands that exist in a different world. The member islands existed in our world until around the 14th to the 16th century, but relocated through anomalous means to another world, in part to avoid investigation and colonization by the great powers of the time. This resulted in the disappearance of a number of so-called "phantom island", previously documented on nautical charts but unable to be relocated by later expeditions. In the world of the CICP, there are a group of unusual items called "relics", and especially powerful items are called with the initials of T or 丁 and are used for the defense of the member islands. The movement of the member islands out of this world was also made possible by relics, said to have been given by a paranormal civilization known as Thule. Thule is said to have disappeared after the formation of the CICP, and no details of it are known to the inhabitants of the member islands. Travel between our reality and the world of the CICP remains possible, and has been the source of a number of anomalies, some of them dangerous and destructive.

**Location:** Mobile

**Description:** [[[SCP-4700]]] is the designation assigned to several large-scale submersible vehicles under the joint Foundation-Finnfolk command of Operation HIGH TIDE. Currently, only SCP-4700-1 is complete, and is referred to by the Finnfolk as Finnfolkaheem, or alternatively as Guð-Bani (The God-Slayer). It consists of two components: SCP-4700-1-A, a 5 km wide paratechnological "hermit-crab" armed with advanced weapons systems and concealment technology, and SCP-4700-1-B, a crystalline shell containing a vast extradimensional space. A series of nested cylinders have been constructed inside SCP-4700-1-B, 60 km long and 60 km in diameter, creating multiple environments intended for habitation by the Finnfolk, a species of scaled amphibious hominids.

At time of discovery SCP-4700-1-B was overrun by hostile anomalous entities, including [[[SCP-3456]]]. Control over the location was reestablished by the combined efforts of the Foundation and the Finnfolk. Under the terms of the Foundation-Finnfolk Cooperative Agreement, the Finnfolk (Homo aqueous) have been granted permanent asylum aboard SCP-4700-1, and it is currently the largest known Finnfolk settlement.

**Description:** [[[SCP-2344]]], also known as "[[[the-hydra-s-spine|The Hydra’s Spine]]]," is an expansive extradimensional network of underground tunnels, connecting together doorways leading to other planets and realities. The majority of these tunnels are of uniform appearance, passing through smooth dirt, although other appearances have been observed. Entry through a doorway connected to the network can be facilitated by physical contact with at least 7 grams of biological material from a member of the genus Gallus (Chicken), or local equivalent. Exploration is ongoing, including the establishment of outposts for resupply and diplomatic relations, but is complicated by the fact that many doorways connect to the [#wanderers-library Wanderer's Library].

It is inhabited by an unknown number of trapped humans, as well as by faceless entities dressed as IKEA employees (SCP-3008-2). Although harmless at times corresponding to the original store's opening hours, these entities exhibit violent hostility during periods when the store would be closed. The Foundation prevents further entry and amnesticises any individual that manages to leave, although escape is infrequent due to the labyrinthine layout of the extradimensional store.

The prison was built on a slab of granite suspended in an artificial orphan universe half a mile in diameter,  and is only accessible by temporary ways created using thaumatology. Through the use of reality anchors, anti-occult sigils and psionic dampeners, the prison can contain the majority of humanoid anomalies, with specialized countermeasures enabling the maximum security wing to hold even the most powerful mages, reality benders and demigods. Although many attempts have been made, no prisoner has ever successfully escaped from Paramax.

**Surveillance Facility**: [[[secure-facilities-locations|Site-666]]]

**Description:** [[[SCP-7666]]] is a region of space in which the city of Las Vegas overlaps with the Fourth Circle of Hell, the domain of greed. While the Foundation's actions in 1992 were able to anchor Las Vegas to baseline reality, Las Vegas and Hell continue to influence each other. This has resulted in a region of the Fourth Circle resembling a distorted and exaggerated version of Las Vegas, and has also enabled a number of Tartarean-class demonic entities to cross over from this demonic metropolis into Las Vegas. These entities are drawn towards and draw power from alcohol use, sexual intercourse, and gambling, and so it has been deemed impossible to fully exclude them from Las Vegas. Instead, containment of Undervegas involves cooperation with and employment of these Tartarean Entities, to ensure that the general public remains unaware of their presence within the city.

Undervegas is mostly populated by demons of all seven classical sins (i.e. Lust, Greed, Pride, etc.) and is controlled by seven Pit Bosses that each represent one of the seven sins and one of seven estates. The city of Undervegas is split into seven districts or known as estates, each representing a cardinal sin with each estate being controlled by the most powerful demon in that area or at that time, otherwise known as a 'Pit Boss'. The Fourth Estate, or the Moneypit, is the largest of all seven estates which is controlled by Ba'al, the pit boss of that estate.

Following an engineered reality-altering event, the entirety of the country and its geographical boundaries were displaced from consensus reality, leaving behind only [[[SCP-5345]]]. Analysis of documents recovered from SCP-5345 corroborate the existence of a competent national normalcy organization, the West Korean Ministry of Abnormal Affairs, which was primarily responsible for the nation's disappearance.

While it is possible to access the Republic of West Korea by traversing to its current plane of existence -- believed to be one of many potential afterlives -- or [[[SCP-7722|vice versa]]], the presence of unidentified hostile entities haunting the nation's extraplanar territory have prompted the Foundation's current policy of non-invasive monitoring. There are currently no proposals to make contact with the Republic of West Korea, or restore it to baseline reality.

[[tab About this Page]]
This page compiles a list of settings that have been used within the SCP Universe, places for readers to explore and for writers to utilize in their own work. Note that their coexistence on this page does not mean they necessarily coexist in-universe! Also note that different depictions of a location may differ, and there's nothing wrong with changing some of the details to better fit the story you intend to tell.

Nexuses were originally defined on the [[[nexus-series|Nexus Hub]]] as a specific type of article format, although over time various locations were added to the page that were described as Nexuses in SCPs and Tales. Free Ports were added later, as another type of anomalous location. This page also includes a number of additional "Locations of Interest" that appear in multiple articles but aren't officially defined as a Nexus or Free Port. Some anomalous locations will be been omitted from the list above - they either don't have at least 2 appearances in published articles, or they simply haven't been added to the page yet.

The map is the best representation we can manage of where the Locations shown on it are, or at least where they are accessible from, in the case of locations within pocket dimensions or alternate realities. Although it was created using the same map as the [[[secure-facilities-locations|Facilities page]]], created by [[*user L200]], it was inspired by earlier work by IAmPuzzlr, [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/pzugc5/another_guide_poster_for_your_rooms_this_time_for/ posted on reddit].

The images used here are a mixture of flags, coats of arms, signs and logos -- anything that can represent a place. Not all locations have one, and people are welcome to create more. Some existed already, while others were created specifically to be included on this page -- feel free to use them elsewhere!

The first section of this page is for all locations described in a [[[nexus-series|Nexus format]]]. Additional locations that are referred to as a Nexus within an SCP or Tale can be added, as long as they're given a number and described in sufficient detail to enable their inclusion here. Merely mentioning the name and Nexus number is insufficient, although there is a list of those on [[[locations-complete-list| this page]]]. International articles using a non-standard format will be added to the list at the appropriate place numerically if articles are translated, treating Nx-CN-08 as equivalent to Nx-08. Any entirely non-numerical designations will have to be listed at the end of the section.

Free Ports don't have a specified format in exactly the same way, but will generally be treated the same as just another type of Nexus -- if the Free Port number appears in a published article, it can be included in the list.

For Locations of Interest, we're looking for a minimum of 2 appearances -- otherwise we'd end up listing every SCP with the [/system:page-tags/tag/location location] and [/system:page-tags/tag/city city] tags, and we want to keep the length of this page manageable. To count as an appearance, we're looking for more than just the mention of the name -- part of the story should focus on or take place in the Location of Interest. For an alternate reality to count as a Location of Interest, there needs to be a reliable way for people to travel there, as well as some way of communicating information about it back.

++ Adding to the Map
If a Location is added to this list, it can also be added to the map, to indicate the general area it's located in or accessible from. Instructions for doing this can be found on the [[[fragment:locations-map|page where the map is hosted]]].

++ Adding New Images
New images representing specific locations or Nexus types can be added to the page, but before uploading them it's best to get feedback from the creator of the location, or at least from someone who's written articles featuring the location. While there's flexibility on size since the proportions of these images vary, as a general rule the height should not be more than 150px, and the width should not be more than 200px. To keep things consistent, for flags and other wide images set width="200px", while for coats of arms, seals and other round or square logos, set height="150px".

[[tab Nexus Format]]
A Nexus is defined as an actively anomalous area that supports a permanent community. When creating a new Nexus, keep the following characteristics in mind.

++ Low Population
Most Nexuses have very low population numbers, generally with only a few thousand people. A large population would make it much harder for their existence to be concealed by the Foundation, as news of the Nexus's existence would spread much more easily.

++ Nexus Confines
A Nexus's anomalies only occur within the confines of the Nexus (or in certain cases, other Nexuses). For example, you couldn't force the Goatman from Sloth's Pit to exit the confines of the Nexus: the act would simply make him a normal goat after a while. What happens in the Nexus, stays in the Nexus.

++ Thematic Influence
Each Nexus has its central theme that encompasses the entire idea of the anomaly in the Nexus. They can exist anywhere in the world, so long as they have around ~25 people at least, and should not match any real-world location. Besides that, you're free to do whatever you want. If you want a Nexus that rains salmon, go ahead[[footnote]]Someone's already done that idea, unfortunately[[/footnote]].
