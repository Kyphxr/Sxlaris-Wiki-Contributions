The Foundation has identified a number of locations around the world (and beyond it) that are actively anomalous and support permanent communities. While these places would generally be given an SCP designation and evacuated, in some cases this is not possible, due to practical or political constraints. Although not all Locations of Interest are fully controlled by the Foundation,  containment measures are in place to ensure that the general public remains unaware of their existence or anomalous nature.

An inhabited anomalous location designated as a Nexus permits residents to remain within it, under the supervision of the Foundation or another Group of Interest, since the anomalous properties of a Nexus generally cannot extend beyond its borders. Additionally, the Foundation has permitted the existence of a number of Free Ports, paranormal enclaves and other locations accessible only through anomalous means, within which the concealment and containment of anomalies is unnecessary. These communities are usually self-managed, with observation from the Foundation and local governments to ensure that anomalous phenomena remain within the Free Port. A number of additional Locations of Interest are known to the Foundation at this time, ranging in scale from small towns to entire countries, as well as entire alternate realities accessible from our own.

**Accessible From:** Baseline, Multiverse

**Description:** This vast extradimensional library allegedly catalogs everything that has ever been written down, containing countless books that cannot be found anywhere else, including many documenting the occult and paranormal. Although the Foundation has been aware of the Library since 1955, it has existed for much longer than that. The Library is also known as the Nexus of Worlds and the Great Library Yggdrasil due to its connection to multiple universes, with a particularly close connection to other anomalous libraries such as [[[SCP-1726]]] and [[[SCP-4001]]]. The Nexus and the books within are maintained and protected by various inhuman entities known as [[[wanderers-library-hub|Librarians]]]. Individuals that harm the Library, its books, or its patrons are punished by transformation into one of these Librarians, serving the Library until they work off their debt. This has been the fate of a number of Foundation personnel during incursions into the Library, and so the Foundation has adopted a more diplomatic approach to this specific location. The Library is reportedly headed by an entity known as [[[divine-dossier#the-serpent| The Serpent]]], and serves as the base of operations for GoI-014 ("[[[serpent-s-hand-hub|The Serpent's Hand]]]").

**Description:**  The Republic of New Atlantis, also known The Restored Thalassocracy of the Peoples of the Sea, is an Atlantean Colony and a City-State located in Arizona. It was founded by a small number of Atlanteans (//Homo sapiens aquarius//) removed from [[[SCP-5525]]], where they were maintained in stasis within an anomalous device known as the "Untimely Mirror". The Atlanteans were subsequently granted a small region of land around a reservoir by the US Government, which has been developed into a small but secluded city, concealed through techno-thaumaturgy, but heavily monitored by the United States Military. Serving as a continuation of the original Atlantis, New Atlantis has an oligarchic and thalassocratic republic, with the rulers being the Admiralty Board of Senator-Admirals, elected from the New Atlantis Senate. The relationship between Atlantean race and the United States Government is based on the [[[paralaw|Biltmore Treaty]]], which was established with the help of the United Nation's [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition]]].

**Location:** Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; The Fourth Circle of Hell

**Surveillance Facility**: [[[secure-facilities-locations|Site-666]]]

**Description:** [[[SCP-7666]]] is a region of space in which the city of Las Vegas overlaps with the Fourth Circle of Hell, the domain of greed. While the Foundation's actions in 1992 were able to anchor Las Vegas to baseline reality, Las Vegas and Hell continue to influence each other. This has resulted in a region of the Fourth Circle resembling a distorted and exaggerated version of Las Vegas, and has also enabled a number of Tartarean-class demonic entities to cross over from this demonic metropolis into Las Vegas. These entities are drawn towards and draw power from alcohol use, sexual intercourse, and gambling, and so it has been deemed impossible to fully exclude them from Las Vegas. Instead, containment of Undervegas involves cooperation with and employment of these Tartarean Entities, to ensure that the general public remains unaware of their presence within the city.

Undervegas is mostly populated by demons of all seven classical sins (i.e. Lust, Greed, Pride, etc.) and is controlled by seven Pit Bosses that each represent one of the seven sins and one of seven estates. The city of Undervegas is split into seven districts or known as estates, each representing a cardinal sin with each estate being controlled by the most powerful demon in that area or at that time, otherwise known as a 'Pit Boss'. The Fourth Estate, or the Moneypit, is the largest of all seven estates which is controlled by Ba'al, the pit boss of that estate.

[[tab About this Page]]
This page compiles a list of settings that have been used within the SCP Universe, places for readers to explore and for writers to utilize in their own work. Note that their coexistence on this page does not mean they necessarily coexist in-universe! Also note that different depictions of a location may differ, and there's nothing wrong with changing some of the details to better fit the story you intend to tell.

Nexuses were originally defined on the [[[nexus-series|Nexus Hub]]] as a specific type of article format, although over time various locations were added to the page that were described as Nexuses in SCPs and Tales. Free Ports were added later, as another type of anomalous location. This page also includes a number of additional "Locations of Interest" that appear in multiple articles but aren't officially defined as a Nexus or Free Port. Some anomalous locations will be been omitted from the list above - they either don't have at least 2 appearances in published articles, or they simply haven't been added to the page yet.

The map is the best representation we can manage of where the Locations shown on it are, or at least where they are accessible from, in the case of locations within pocket dimensions or alternate realities. Although it was created using the same map as the [[[secure-facilities-locations|Facilities page]]], created by [[*user L200]], it was inspired by earlier work by IAmPuzzlr, [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/pzugc5/another_guide_poster_for_your_rooms_this_time_for/ posted on reddit].

The images used here are a mixture of flags, coats of arms, signs and logos -- anything that can represent a place. Not all locations have one, and people are welcome to create more. Some existed already, while others were created specifically to be included on this page -- feel free to use them elsewhere!

[[tab Adding to this Page]]
This collaborative page is open for any site member to edit and add to, but you're welcome to make suggestions or get feedback on proposed additions in the Discussion. In general, the idea was to be as inclusive as possible within the general scope of "inhabited anomalous location".

Anyone is welcome to add to the list of articles in which a location appears or is described, although we're looking for more than just a brief mention. If there is a tag, please limit the appearances to no more than the 5, prioritising the most relevant or most informative articles.

This page is the responsibility of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/curation-main Curation Team]. If you have any questions or suggestions, you can contact us via the #help-desk channel on the [https://discord.com/invite/scp SCP Wiki Official Discord server], or via [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chat-guide IRC chat #site17], or by messaging a member of the Collaboration Pages subteam.

++ Adding New Locations

The first section of this page is for all locations described in a [[[nexus-series|Nexus format]]]. Additional locations that are referred to as a Nexus within an SCP or Tale can be added, as long as they're given a number and described in sufficient detail to enable their inclusion here. Merely mentioning the name and Nexus number is insufficient, although there is a list of those on [[[locations-complete-list| this page]]]. International articles using a non-standard format will be added to the list at the appropriate place numerically if articles are translated, treating Nx-CN-08 as equivalent to Nx-08. Any entirely non-numerical designations will have to be listed at the end of the section.

Free Ports don't have a specified format in exactly the same way, but will generally be treated the same as just another type of Nexus -- if the Free Port number appears in a published article, it can be included in the list.

For Locations of Interest, we're looking for a minimum of 2 appearances -- otherwise we'd end up listing every SCP with the [/system:page-tags/tag/location location] and [/system:page-tags/tag/city city] tags, and we want to keep the length of this page manageable. To count as an appearance, we're looking for more than just the mention of the name -- part of the story should focus on or take place in the Location of Interest. For an alternate reality to count as a Location of Interest, there needs to be a reliable way for people to travel there, as well as some way of communicating information about it back.

++ Adding to the Map
If a Location is added to this list, it can also be added to the map, to indicate the general area it's located in or accessible from. Instructions for doing this can be found on the [[[fragment:locations-map|page where the map is hosted]]].

++ Adding New Images
New images representing specific locations or Nexus types can be added to the page, but before uploading them it's best to get feedback from the creator of the location, or at least from someone who's written articles featuring the location. While there's flexibility on size since the proportions of these images vary, as a general rule the height should not be more than 150px, and the width should not be more than 200px. To keep things consistent, for flags and other wide images set width="200px", while for coats of arms, seals and other round or square logos, set height="150px".

[[tab Nexus Format]]
A Nexus is defined as an actively anomalous area that supports a permanent community. When creating a new Nexus, keep the following characteristics in mind.

++ Low Population
Most Nexuses have very low population numbers, generally with only a few thousand people. A large population would make it much harder for their existence to be concealed by the Foundation, as news of the Nexus's existence would spread much more easily.

++ Nexus Confines
A Nexus's anomalies only occur within the confines of the Nexus (or in certain cases, other Nexuses). For example, you couldn't force the Goatman from Sloth's Pit to exit the confines of the Nexus: the act would simply make him a normal goat after a while. What happens in the Nexus, stays in the Nexus.

++ Thematic Influence
Each Nexus has its central theme that encompasses the entire idea of the anomaly in the Nexus. They can exist anywhere in the world, so long as they have around ~25 people at least, and should not match any real-world location. Besides that, you're free to do whatever you want. If you want a Nexus that rains salmon, go ahead[[footnote]]Someone's already done that idea, unfortunately[[/footnote]].

++ The Nexus Format
