Segmentation is a method of cutting in which the fabric of space time itself is cut, rather than the physical matter of the object being segmented. This creates one of two results: 1. It allows objects to be cut into pieces, without interfering with the objects function, and 2. It allows for the creation of non-Euclidean zones in standard reality.
