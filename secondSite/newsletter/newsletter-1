++ Aesthetics With Feelings 
Liminality, Dreamcore, Oddcore, Weirdcore. There are plenty of aesthetics that have cropped up since the inception of the internet that rely on the feelings they elicit, as much, if not more than, they rely on the actual visuals they provide. 

These aesthetics often fall on the lower side of the fidelity scale in terms of visuals, allowing them to create a surreal or dreamlike quality.

These emotionally charged styles have been the driving force behind numerous projects and ideas, and account for billions of views on social media platforms like Youtube and Tiktok. Most obviously, the concept of liminality is an integral part of The Backrooms, a pocket dimension of seemingly infinite proportions, housing any and all types of liminal spaces.

The Backrooms itself is the inspiration behind hundreds of games, most notably, The Complex: Expedition, POOLS, Liminalcore, Vastophobia, Dreamcore, Kult Rising, and many, many more.
