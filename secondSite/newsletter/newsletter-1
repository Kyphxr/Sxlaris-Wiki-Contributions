++ Aesthetics With Feelings 
Liminality, Dreamcore, Oddcore, Weirdcore. There are plenty of aesthetics that have cropped up since the inception of the internet that rely on the feelings they elicit, as much, if not more than, they rely on the actual visuals they provide. 

These aesthetics often fall on the lower side of the fidelity scale in terms of visuals, allowing them to create a surreal or dreamlike quality.

These emotionally charged styles have been the driving force behind numerous projects and ideas, and account for billions of views on social media platforms like Youtube and Tiktok. Most obviously, the concept of liminality is an integral part of The Backrooms, a pocket dimension of seemingly infinite proportions, housing any and all types of liminal spaces.

The Backrooms itself is the inspiration behind hundreds of games, most notably, The Complex: Expedition, POOLS, Liminalcore, Vastophobia, Dreamcore, Kult Rising, and many, many more.

And I think what truly ties all of these different aesthetics into one sort of "genre" is the surrealism element. Its surrealism that gives nostalgiacore and dreamcore its dreamlike properties, its surrealism that builds the uncanniness of the backrooms and liminality, and its surrealism that allows for other feelings, like megalophobia, to be seamlessly woven into these aesthetics. 

Take Liminalcore for example, and its famous canvas covered giant. Despite not really falling into the liminal category in any way, the sight of what appears to be an enormous person, some 15 meters tall, draped in an impossibly large canvas cloth is one of the most striking and memorable visuals from the game, and thanks to IGP, the thumbnail of many youtube videos.
