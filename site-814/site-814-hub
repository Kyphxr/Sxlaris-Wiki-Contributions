[[tab That Which Can Be Said]]

++* Beginnings

The Sxlaris canon seeks to merge the worlds of the SCP Foundation, with the Backrooms. SCP-3008 has always been on of my favorite SCPs, and naturally that extension of spatial anomalies and non-euclidean geometry ultimately led to the creation of [[[SCP-x002]]].

While liminality is certainly everpresent in the Sxlaris universe, it is far from its exclusive goal. This universe aims to depict a world where the Foundation is not the un-challengeable force you may be used to. With the rise of the corporations, human augmentations, and various other clandestine groups to challenge them, the Foundation of Sxlaris failed to protect humanity from that which hides in the dark.

++* Middles

The second tenet is that Site-17's fiction runs on a vibe. Highly atmospheric and emotionally-driven, Deepwell presents a world defined by wrongness; institutions tasked with the safeguarding of humanity have taken on a certain malignancy. Control, prided by the Foundation as a central dogma, seems more and more every day like a facade to hide the unknown forces to which the men in charge have given themselves, and the world.

++* Continuations

Preferably, articles written for Site-17 should incorporate one or more of the following elements into their fiction:

* Inclusion of, or references to, established characters or events within the canon
* Ethics Committee interactions
* Thematic interest in secrecy, truth, and/or the sacrifices made to maintain the Veil

In any case, feel free to parent your article to this page and add it here when it's posted. The applicable tag is {{deepwell-catalog}}.

Note that the ADMONITION Series is set in an alternate continuity which runs on a similar vibe and thematic interest. It is currently closed to collaboration.

++ Thaumaturgical Manifestations

Thaumaturgical Entities are objects or beings imbued with arcane energy. These entities are not anomalous, and operate in line with our understanding of "Magick."

++ Timeline Of Important Events

This primarily exists as a vain attempt to ensure that characters born in 1990 don't become Site Directors in 1970. It's harder than you'd think!
