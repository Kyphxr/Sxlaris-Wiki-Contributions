------

Site-814 acts as the Foundation's primary containment site for spatial, geographical, and non-Euclidean anomalies. Site-814 is one of the most highly classified foundation sites, with only select site heads and researchers outside of the Overseer council even knowing of its existence.

[[tab That Which Can Be Said]]

++* Beginnings

The Sxlaris canon seeks to merge the worlds of the SCP Foundation, with the Backrooms. SCP-3008 has always been on of my favorite SCPs, and naturally that extension of spatial anomalies and non-euclidean geometry ultimately led to the creation of [[[SCP-x002]]].

While liminality is certainly everpresent in the Sxlaris universe, it is far from its exclusive goal. This universe aims to depict a world where the Foundation is not the un-challengeable force you may be used to. With the rise of the corporations, human augmentations, and various other clandestine groups to challenge them, the Foundation of Sxlaris failed to protect humanity from that which hides in the dark.

++* Middles

Sxlaris is a dystopian cyberpunk world that focuses more on elements of dark sci-fi/fantasy, rather than the horror typically associated with the SCP Foundation. This world is bleak and gray. Nothing is simple, nobody is always right, and its up to you who you chose to align yourself with.

[[tab That Which Can Be Known]]

++ Thaumaturgical Manifestations

Thaumaturgical Entities are objects or beings imbued with arcane energy. These entities are not anomalous, and operate in line with our understanding of "Magick."

++ Timeline Of Important Events

This primarily exists as a vain attempt to ensure that characters born in 1990 don't become Site Directors in 1970. It's harder than you'd think!
