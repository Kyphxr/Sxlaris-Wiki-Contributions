[[tab That Which Can Be Said]]

++* Beginnings

The first tenet of Site-17's fiction is that the Foundation is, at its core, evil. It is a hierarchical, bureaucratic institution which seeks to enforce ignorance as law and is plainly hostile to the world at large. It worships the greater ethical good but has no method of defining what that good is.

Perhaps, the researchers within the Foundation have not realized this. Perhaps even the Overseers are likewise deluded. But the ones who have been trampled beneath the weight of the Foundation's transgressions are not so blind.

++* Middles

The second tenet is that Site-17's fiction runs on a vibe. Highly atmospheric and emotionally-driven, Deepwell presents a world defined by wrongness; institutions tasked with the safeguarding of humanity have taken on a certain malignancy. Control, prided by the Foundation as a central dogma, seems more and more every day like a facade to hide the unknown forces to which the men in charge have given themselves, and the world.

++* Continuations

Preferably, articles written for Site-17 should incorporate one or more of the following elements into their fiction:

* Inclusion of, or references to, established characters or events within the canon
* Ethics Committee interactions
* Thematic interest in secrecy, truth, and/or the sacrifices made to maintain the Veil

In any case, feel free to parent your article to this page and add it here when it's posted. The applicable tag is {{deepwell-catalog}}.

Note that the ADMONITION Series is set in an alternate continuity which runs on a similar vibe and thematic interest. It is currently closed to collaboration.

++ Thaumaturgical Manifestations

Thaumaturgical Entities are objects or beings imbued with arcane energy. These entities are not anomalous, and operate in line with our understanding of "Magick."

++ Timeline Of Important Events

This primarily exists as a vain attempt to ensure that characters born in 1990 don't become Site Directors in 1970. It's harder than you'd think!
