+ What is the Museum of Anomalous Things?
The Museum of Anomalous Things is a modified version of the [*https://may.as/moat/ Museum of All Things], developed by Maya Claire, that aims to create a infinite virtual museum of SCP, Backrooms, and Sxlaris related content.

+ What is the Museum of All Things?
The Museum of All Things (or "The MoAT") is a vast, liminal museum that is literally (basically) infinite. Explore exhibits from tens of millions of topics, from anime, to the most popular sci-fi movies of all time, to how to cook an omelette! Every exhibit in the museum corresponds to a Wikipedia article. The walls of the exhibit are covered in images and text from the article, and hallways lead out to other exhibits based on the article's links.
