+++ Update 5: 
+++++ The Skilltree
* adds Morgan and the core skill tree
* Adds xp system
* All condensed quartz is converted to xp 

[[collapsible show="‡ Update 4 Content" hide="‡ Hide"]]
------
+++ Skill Tree
* the skill tree is probably the most complex element of the game and therefor the most polarizing
* We recognize a lot of people are turned off by games like PoE specifically because of its skill tree, and so we have designed our game to make the entire skill tree more or less optional
* Every time you gain a level in the skill tree, it will automatically unlock the next skill in your current chain. The default chain is setup to be able to clear the entire game and is more or less our “intended” build
* However if you’re someone who enjoys experimenting with different skills and abilities and coming up with your own builds, you can switch the skill tree over to advanced mode and have access to the entire catalogue of skills
* As you unlock new syms, their skill chains will be unlocked in your skill tree, allowing you to learn those abilities in the core gameplay loop
* The skill tree is made up of both active and passive skills, and you can respec at any time for free to test out any new abilities or skills
* Use our skill path module to save and export your current build as code that your friends can enter so they can use your builds without having to mess with the skill tree
* If your friend is a lower level than you, it will replace the default path allowing them to automatically level up with the right skills as they grind
