+ What is the Museum of Anomalous Things?
The Museum of Anomalous Things is a modified version of the [*https://may.as/moat/ Museum of All Things], developed by Maya Claire, that aims to create a infinite virtual museum of SCP, Backrooms, and Sxlaris related content.

+ How do you handle different Backrooms and SCP Canons?
At the moment we simply mark somewhere in the exhibit (usually at the beginning) which canon or wiki the information came from. This mostly applies to Backrooms content that has several different canons that are scattered across different wikis (Wikidot, Kane Pixels Canon, Fandom Canon, etc). The SCP Foundation on the other hand has a centralized system, so there's not too much to worry about when it comes to getting canons confused.

+ What is the Museum of All Things?
The Museum of All Things (or "The MoAT") is a vast, liminal museum that is literally (basically) infinite. Explore exhibits from tens of millions of topics, from anime, to the most popular sci-fi movies of all time, to how to cook an omelette! Every exhibit in the museum corresponds to a Wikipedia article. The walls of the exhibit are covered in images and text from the article, and hallways lead out to other exhibits based on the article's links.
