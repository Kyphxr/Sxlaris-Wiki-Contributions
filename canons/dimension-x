For [http://sxlaris.wikidot.com/licensing-and-third-party-content licensing reasons], the term "Sxlaris" is not an in universe name for the canon, but an external label more akin to "Star Wars." In order to prevent confusion over licensing with CC-BY-SA, any in universe mention of the Sxlaris universe, especially outside of this Wiki, is referred to as "Dimension-X"

TL:DR
Dimension-X is the in universe and license free name of the Sxlaris Canon.
