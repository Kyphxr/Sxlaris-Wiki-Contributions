[[tab Overview]]
In 2006, existence itself experienced a timeline collapse. As a result of this "Incident Zero," the world skipped ahead 23 years, but nobody noticed. Well //almost// nobody noticed. With 23 years of history implanted in the minds of humanity, those who remember, are forced to conform to a new era. A darker era.

Gone are the days of global clandestine operations, gone are the infinite pockets of the Foundation's resources. Something is coming for the Foundation, and its coming //fast//, but not enough people are able to notice.

When global corruption and corporate dominion lead to an intrusion of the veil, the Foundation find themselves in a world where they are not the foremost experts on anomalies.


-----
**Sxlaris** is a worldbuilding project aimed at combining 10+ years of creatures, worlds, and stories created by [[user kyphxr]] and Rinzlxrd, along with the SCP Universe, and the Backrooms. This story sort of acts as an alternate reality of the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/resurrection Resurrection Canon] of the SCP Foundation, diverging from the point of the timeline collapse in Incident Zero to tell a new story.
