[!- Then you can add a short introduction. (Note: You may have seen pages with "Level n is the n+1th level of the Backrooms" here, but this has fallen out of fashion due to not being a strong hook.) -]

If there are no bases, outposts or communities, you may write:

skip this section entirely (often preferrable) --]

+ Additional Content
[!-- Feel free to rename this section and/or add any content in relation with that level.
If you have nothing to add simply remove this section --]
 
[!--
There are a variety of other sections you can include in the page as well, for example:

Entities
Phenomena
Objects
Feel free to also make separate sections for things you think warrant a separate section.

These often go between Description and Bases & Outposts, or Entrances and Exits if there are no settlements.

++++ Entrances

++++ Exits
[!-- If there are no exits please write: "There is no known way to leave this level for now.", though usually people can leave whence they came. --]
