[[tab Overview]]

The O5 Council. O5 Command. The Overseers. Overwatch.

These are the people who have ultimate control over the Foundation.

Each O5 member knows almost everything there is to know about the Foundation and its activities. Between them all, they know every single secret that the Foundation holds.

Most Foundation personnel spend their entire careers without seeing them. Members below Clearance Level 2 don't even know they exist. Most people outside the Foundation have never heard of them, or don't think they are real.

Most everyone is afraid of them. An O5 walks into a room, and everyone pisses their pants. That's what happens when you hold supreme power over one of the scariest organizations in world history.

**This dossier will show you contradictory reports on each of the O5 Council members.**

My research has been comprehensive, but the very nature of my enemy makes it impossible to know which answer, if any, is true.

There seem to be thirteen members of the O5 Council, although even that is questionable. Perhaps there are multiple individuals sharing each O5 number. Perhaps dozens. But perhaps there is only one. Perhaps only one of each of the reports is true, or all reports are different facets of one person, with stand-ins and disinformation stirred in.

Perhaps none of these are true. The end of this dossier presents well-sourced reports that question the veracity of //almost every single assumption made here//. You must judge carefully.

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-1]]

**O5-1: "The Founder".**

Female. European descent. American origin. Verified post-human lifespan; 148+ years of age. Varying appearance.

A holdover of the occult organizations preceding the Foundation, so she likely benefits from more preservation techniques than merely [[[SCP-006]]], and she likely possesses a large degree of anomalous protection.

Evidence strongly suggests that she was born in the late 1800s (possibly 1866) as " [DATA EXPUNGED]". Certainly, [DATA EXPUNGED] was a physicist studying at Cornell University in 1891, disappearing from the historical record in this year. This timeline doesn't match what we know of O5-1's activity, but given her position and the reality-restructuring events that have occurred, it's entirely possible.

Rumor has it that she's [Gears'] [grandmother]. If true, this would make her the Black Queen's grandmother.

--------------------

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-2]]

**O5-2: "The Gardener".**

Female. European descent. American origin. Appears to be 80+ years old. Actual age unknown. No unusual appearance, but rarely seen without a [[[ecceperago| shawl, gloves and hat]]].

O5-2 is [[[annon| apparently a second version of Foundation Director Dr. Sophia Light]]], a holdover from an erased timeline (she seems to have had [[[yesterday| a hand in this erasure]]]). She is very different from the current Sophia Light, Director of Site-41, who is unaware of her alternate's status or identity. Considered extremely dangerous, even compared to the other O5s. Known for making tough, pragmatic decisions, but also said to have a [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army| grandmotherly attitude and appearance]]].

Promotes research of SCP objects and the anomalous in general. Has consistently stuck to this despite regularly shifting Foundation attitudes towards containment versus research. Pushed for a reasonable degree of anomalous object [[[capitis| cross-testing]]]. Implemented higher standards of non-SCP anomalous item categorization by the Foundation. Strong believer in pragmatic research (or theoretical research that leads to pragmatic work), believing this to be most beneficial to the Foundation in the long run. Wishes to deconstruct the anomalous so that the Foundation understands it.

Rarely seen in public. According to [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army| some sources]]], she's always accompanied by an elderly man - may also be an alternate version of a current Foundation employee?

Maintains several SCP objects considered key to O5 Command, notably [[[SCP-006]]].

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-3]]

**O5-3: "The Kid", or "The All-seeing Eye".**

Male (?). European descent (apparently). Unknown origin. Appears to be 17-19, despite being certainly much older. Always has long blond hair, glasses, patched jean jacket, and a single bone earring. Never seen in person; communicates via computer terminal.

Usually presents as male, sometimes as female, sometimes non-binary/other. Never explains this. An informant suggested to me that it's a computer error; I find it hard to believe it's not on purpose.

Original identity unknown. Various intelligence reports claim that he (?) is actually dead, and only exists in the [[[ecceperago|computer matrices he created]]] as an [[[goc-or-that-guy-with-a-gun-fetish| artificial intelligence]]]. Excessively friendly in personality. Usually. A relatively active O5 member at certain Sites.

Assorted rumors hold that O5-3 is the brother of [[[SCP-2772]]] (probable), and may have helped invent the Internet in the 1960's (unknown).

May have never been human - possibly an artificial intelligence referred to in [[[scp-0000-ex|Foundation documentation]]] as the "All-seeing Eye".

 _
[/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii/offset/23 "The Swallowed Tail" source] connects "The Kid" with an image of dubious provenance depicting a Korean child, but regards this image with skepticism. True appearance of O5-3 unknown.

O5-3 is reportedly the head of the Foundation's Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration, managing all of the Foundation's digital records. Appears to be capable of predicting future events, including extranormal ones. Is this just a matter of having all of the data, or are anomalous means being used?

---------------

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-4]]

**O5-4: "The Ambassador".**

Male. Australian (Koori) descent. Canadian origin. Mid-40s. No unusual appearance. Assigned female at birth.

Former Foundation field agent. Many recorded sightings; unlike all other members of O5 Command, commonly interacts with agents or representatives of outside anomalous groups of interest.

He also works with the Administrator in a more traditional ambassador role, privately meeting with heads of state and high-tier organizations such as the Global Occult Coalition/United Nations to negotiate such matters as Foundation access to countries. Has a sizable staff of diplomats working under him.

[[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army|Allegedly capable]]] of traveling vast distances in an impossibly short time - apparently by foot. Surprisingly open about personal details, but the details of this ability are kept under wraps.

Pertinently: How does he keep finding me? And why doesn't he share that with the rest of the Foundation? Possibly bound to an esoteric/anomalous rule-set. Requires investigation.

Excerpt from intercepted communication:

> A lot of fieldwork and being in the wrong place at the right time. Got to be a little bit of a diplomat, and ended up getting sent out to talk to various GOIs over the years. Got pretty good at it. Too good, really.
> Another of those who ended up being promoted because he's so damned good at his job, but not entirely trusted, because he walks places people shouldn't go, and keeps secrets.
> His loyalty isn't in doubt.  Just the wisdom of his excursions.

 _
[/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii/offset/21 "The Swallowed Tail" source] also depicts the Ambassador as the public face of the Foundation, but differs on all other details. Described as a Persian male, Iranian/Armenian ancestry, early-thirties, originally a French stage actor known as Jean Lemieux Betrand, born Jean Ebrahimi.

Allegedly "anomalously charismatic", but there's no evidence that he's anything more than a pretty face. Defers to O5-7 "Green". Loyalty to the Foundation is questionable - possible weak link?

--------------

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-5]]

**O5-5: "Blackbird".**

Male.  European/Middle Eastern descent. American origin. Appears to be mid-40s; almost certainly older. Favors tweed suits, usually worn with coat and a hat with a blackbird pin. Wears ties with birds. [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army|Blackbirds seem to be some sort of personal motif]]] - unknown significance, if any.

Overly friendly and familiar in demeanor. Tends to be laid-back and jovial given the option. One of the more prominent O5s, relatively often seen in public. Little is known about his specific role, though he has been on the Council a long time.

An artist of some talent; [[[the-flytrap|known to sketch five blackbirds as a signature]]].

 _
[/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii/offset/19 "The Swallowed Tail" source] describes "Blackbird" as the head of the Department of Paranormal Organisation Review, which records and monitors the Foundation's "Groups of Interest". Also takes an interest in anomalies interacting with alternate realities. Subordinates report overhearing him talking to himself, and acting like different people at different times.

This individual seems to always occupy a prominent position within an [[[groups-of-interest|organisation focused on the anomalous]]], even in realities in which he isn't a member of the Foundation. He can be bargained with, but __do not underestimate him__. He may well be the most dangerous member of the O5 Council.

-----------


[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-6]]

**O5-6: "Cowboy", or "The American".**

Male. European descent. American origin. Mid-40s. Long hair kept in a ponytail. Nearly always dresses in [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army|white suits]]], with a white Stetson "Boss of the Plains" cowboy hat, and carries a white cane with the handle carved in the shape of a wolf's head. Unknown significance, if any.

[[[ecceperago|Former top Foundation field agent]]]; other details of prior identity unknown (probable wipe) but he may be a member of the [[[codebrown|Bright Family]]]. Professional yet genial. Reputation for high competency. Plays something of a "jack of all trades" role within the Foundation, but focuses particularly on issues of Foundation security.

One of the O5s seen more often in public. Travels with two male bodyguards referred to as "Thompson" and "Black".

 _
[/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii/offset/17 "The Swallowed Tail" source] indicates that "The American" was once known as Rufus King, a Union Brigadier General and Minister to the Papal States before joining the Foundation. Now serves as "Special Council to the Joint Chiefs of Staff", liaison between the Foundation and the Pentagon. Has authority just below (or just above?) that of the US President. Commands the Foundation's Department of Applied Influence (Private Army), alleged to have founded Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 "Red Right Hand". May have been involved in the creation of Mobile Task Force Omega-7 "Pandora's Box" at the behest of General Bowe, despite initial opposition to this project.

Prioritises American interests. Arrogant, often overconfident. Skilled with a whip.

Appears to be in his mid-fifties, but for his military record to be true he'd have to be the oldest Council Member, with some way of extending his lifespan even before joining the Foundation. This is either a blatant fabrication by someone who couldn't even get the dates right, or worth looking into further.

------------

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-7]]

**O5-7: "Green".**

Female. South Asian descent. Unknown origin. Appears to be mid-40s; almost certainly older. Somewhat overweight. Nearly always dresses in various shades of green clothing. Unknown significance, if any.

One of the longer-term members of the O5 Council. Described as not especially morally scrupulous with her power, although with her heart in the right place, or at least near the right place. A master tactician, charismatic and dangerous.

Does not often appear in public, and often works through intermediaries at first; a believer in private meetings over public speeches. Generally friendly in demeanor in personal interactions, right up until she's not.

Possibly an ex-university professor (surprisingly). Has implemented a number of training programs in various areas across the Foundation.

Also notable for "adopting" Dr. Alto Clef and approving a number of his experimental (and sometimes unnecessarily dangerous) projects.

Takes an active interest in Foundation personnel; [[[The Flytrap|often plays a role in recruiting O5 Council general staff]]]. Also plays [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army|an active role]]] in the development of experimental and even anomalous weaponry.

 _
[/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii/offset/15 "The Swallowed Tail" source] identifies a somewhat similar O5-7. "Green" or "Flytrap" is described as a Caucasian female of British/German ancestry, appearing to be in her early fifties. Nickname comes from her green pantsuits.

Believed to have had a long career within the Foundation before being voted onto the council, possibly as the first replacement of an original council member. Ruthlessly pursues her (unknown) goals, //de facto// leader of the O5 Council as long as O5-1 does not exercise veto power. Her appearances are a source of dread for those outside of the Foundation, who describe her as "The Devil" or "The Spider". Despite her reputation, she does not appear to possess any anomalous abilities.

----------

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-8]]

**O5-8: "The Newbie", or "The Lesser".**

Male. European descent. American origin. Mid-30s. No unusual appearance.

A former Foundation Site Director; a recent elevation to the O5 Council (between 6 and 9 years as of 2014).

One of his first actions as an O5 Council member was to approve of Dr. Kondraki's plan to neutralize the [[[duke-till-dawn| former SCP-083]]]. This plan resulted in the breaching of multiple SCP objects, including Kondraki deliberately breaching [[[SCP-682]]], and in the near destruction of Site-19. This incident appears to have led to the O5-ordered assassination of Kondraki by Dr. Gears.

Though he was not removed from the O5 Council over this, [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army|O5-8 never recovered]]], and is now much more cautious. Still shaken from the fallout of the incident, he continues to rely on support staff to accomplish all of his duties -- including the hiring and replacing of support staff.

Thus far, O5-8 has avoided further serious incidents, but rumor has it that the situation with his current crop of staff is unstable and likely to cause further "mistakes".

Possibly assassinated. Has not appeared in public for some time.

 _
[/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii/offset/13 "The Swallowed Tail" source] claims that the title of "The Lesser" refers to the American industrialist Baron Leeman Hoadley, much diminished in influence following the death of his brother and the loss of his vast fortune.
Recent physical descriptions are hard to come by, since he rarely leaves his personal estate - apparently out of fear of the other Council members. Reportedly obsessed with self-modification through the use of anomalous items, current capabilities unknown.

----------

**O5-8: "Magnolia".**

Female. European descent. Appears to be mid-50s; likely older. [[[ecceperago|Deliberately not beautiful]]] in appearance.

O5-8 is known for being brutal and harsh, though never arbitrarily; known for making hard decisions. Known to have played a deciding vote in the decision to nuke several significant Foundation Sites during a particularly deadly breach.

Her physical appearance is deliberate. Overseers certainly can alter their appearance if they wish. This seems to be due to an emotional state plagued by guilt. Considered vulnerable to assassination attempts due to rumors that she would welcome them.

Wears a ring of human sinew. Occult significance obvious.

Possibly assassinated. Has not appeared in public for some time.

------------

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-9]]

**O5-9: "The Outsider", or "The Ordinary."**

Female. European/Pacific Islander descent. New Zealand origin. Appearance consistent with recorded age of 53. Carries a walking stick with jade inlays; item's purpose unclear, whether occult or practical.

O5-9 is one of the most unusual O5s, for an oddly mundane reason: she appears to have been inducted directly into the O5 Council from the public sector.

The reason for her recruitment is unknown, given her complete lack of previous Foundation experience. [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army| Formerly Donna Whetu Taylor, a noted geologist]]], she was inducted shortly after retracting a major publication and resigning in scandal. Stated reason for the retraction was scientific misconduct including fabrication of data, but the scandal was more likely a Foundation cover-up: the few available fragments of the retracted publication suggest that Taylor had discovered several geological and geophysical anomalies, and was developing a general theory of their function.

Strong advocate for research of anomalous phenomena, including those with SCP designations; possible ally of O5-2 ("The Gardener"). Apparently partially responsible for allowing the recent dramatic expansion of the Foundation's classified technical journals (a project apparently spearheaded by Regional Director Katherine McTiriss, if rumor is correct). Goals appear to include the development of a general explanatory theory for anomalous phenomena.

O5-9's unusual circumstances have led to a large number of contradictory reports. As far as I can tell, she replaced or superseded a prior O5-9 ("Misfortune").

It's said her appointment barely passed, with a Council vote of 7 to 6. At least three votes swung to her side at the last moment. Evidence of tension within Overwatch?

 _
Of note: Many sources claim that O5-9 is personally close with O5-10 ("The Archivist"), but [/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii/offset/11 "The Swallowed Tail" source] claims extreme antagonism. It's doubtful this is a coincidence. The two are intertwined, one way or another. I wouldn't doubt that both claims are true, because both were involved in a certain incident which would be unwise for us to discuss in this forum. One might say I recommend drawing zero conclusions.

-------------

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-10]]

**O5-10: "The Anchor".**

Male. African/European descent. American origin. Appears to be mid-40s. Tends to wear grey striped suits.

O5-10 plays the role of archivist and record-keeper. He acts as custodian of the records of previous iterations of the planet and associated timelines.

These records show how many times Earth (or the timeline associated with Earth) has been severely damaged and "reset", and how many "resets" the Foundation has allowed, or stopped. Additionally, O5-10's records include the full number of K-Class events that the Foundation has ever been aware of (including some information passed from prior timelines). Most of the O5 Council does not have access to this information, and only O5-10 has access to all of it.

O5-10 inherited his role from a prior O5-10, and therefore has been an O5 Council member for several years. However, he has only recently become publicly active within the Foundation. He has "adopted" a number of newer researchers, and taken special interest in [[[SCP-2000]]] and similar SCP items related to major K-Class scenarios.

[[[The High Court With The Magic Army| Accompanied by an assistant/decoy]]], referred to only as "Salt".

"The Anchor" may have [[[captain-kirby-s-proposal|access to]]] the [[[wanderers-library-hub|Wanderer's Library]]], and be capable of [[[capitis| "magic"]]], learned from Library books.

O5-10 has a hand selected mobile task force designated MTF Alpha-Ω "Zero Day," that operate under his command alone, headquartered in [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2000 SCP-2000].


-------------

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-11]]

**O5-11: "The Mailman".**

Male. European descent. Eastern European origin. 80+. No unusual appearance.

Origin of nickname uncertain; possibly [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army|an actual mailman]]] before appointment to the council. Nickname is in common use; staff often joke about him "going postal", but admit he is one of the most even-tempered and kind people they've ever met. Grandfatherly in demeanor.

O5-11's most well-known role is to sign off on Termination Orders of Class D personnel, versus approving their transfer to another Site. Whether all Class D are terminated at Sites due to anomalous exposure, or merely transferred to another site, O5-11 makes the final decision.

Confirmed to have held at least one other O5 number, though the number itself is unknown. May be an indication of a standard number changeover process, or perhaps of unknown internal political maneuvering.

-----------------

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-12]]

**O5-12: "The Accountant".**

Male. African descent. African origin. Appears to be mid-40s; almost certainly older. Large-bodied. Always dresses in extremely expensive tailored clothing with similarly expensive jewelry. Wears dark wrap-around glasses: smoked glass framed in ivory. May or may not be to hide his eyes. Likely occult significance.

O5-12 plays the role of [[[ecceperago| accountant for the Overseer Council]]]. A mathematical genius; ensures all the Foundation's numbers add up. Has access to certain data that no other Foundation member does, for this purpose.

Precise, calm, practical. A strong believer in order. Every part of his daily route, and indeed every action he takes, right down to his drinking habit, is strictly scheduled.

 _
[/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii/offset/5 "The Swallowed Tail" source] presents an alternate but still somewhat consistent picture of this O5-12. Not an original Council member, "Omar Alawe" was promoted following the death of the previous O5-12. His mathematical ability allows him to see correlations invisible to everyone else - not quite precognition, but may as well be. Some of the background is misinformation (likely including the photo -- though I can't be sure, for obvious reasons), but trying to verify this information led down some interesting paths.

-------------


[[/tab]]

[[tab O5-13]]

**O5-13: "Tamlin".**

Either male or gender-fluid (reports differ, may be relevant to anomalous traits). Unknown descent (reports differ, may be relevant to anomalous traits). Unknown origin - possibly Middle Eastern? Age unknown. Tall, red-headed.

Per these reports, the "Tiebreaker" reports are accurate. However, O5-13 does exist, despite his vote not being held by himself most of the time. Original identity "Dr. Joseph Tamlin" or possibly "Yoshua bin Yosef" - unclear if these are alternative names for the same person, or different people holding the same position. "Tamlin" [[[codebrown| may (or may not)]]] be more of a title than a specific individual - he/they continue to elude us.

Holds only an advisory position by necessity. Is an anomalously altered human existing in a temporally destabilized state or location; partially "unstuck in time". Acts as a fail-safe for restoring 13's vote to its proper bearer, [[[annon| should it be compromised]]]. [[[iquit| Reserves the right to vote]]], but only exercises this right on [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army|pivotal decisions]]].

Some reports (not all) indicate drastic shifts in appearance, race, and gender, but the presence of red hair (whether natural or colored) remains consistent. Unknown relevance; possible perception alteration issues or literal shape-shifting.

Occupies a room (or rooms) in "Tamlin House", a hidden location related to [[[SCP-1590]]], accessible only through [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army| a number of esoteric methods]]]. Appears to be bound to the location. Does not usually participate directly in O5 Council meetings, but observes most of them (not necessarily synchronously).

"Shows what you know."

------------

[[/tab]]

[[tab The Administrator]]

**Administrator: "Kismet".**

Female. Middle Eastern descent. American origin. Verified post-human lifespan. Appears 50+. No unusual appearance.

Her role is to track down and select each new and future member of O5 Command. She is a trained mathematician, and uses a form of statistics along with occultic procedures for her selection methods. She has personally selected every single member of O5 Command, in some cases years in advance. She occasionally also opts to choose their number, though which number is sometimes kept secret from all others except her and her staff until the new promotion is ready (presumably via a slot being opened).

[[/tab]]

[[tab O5 Staff]]

O5 Command possesses their own [[[Task Forces| Mobile Task Force]]], [[[task-forces#alpha-1| MTF Alpha-01]]], the Red Right Hand. They alternately act as the Foundation researcher's best friend and an outright medieval inquisition, complete with 'disappearing' people who the O5s disfavor.

Besides MTF-Alpha-01, each O5 has their own personal staff and security. Usually O5 personal staff have Level 5 ("Thaumiel") access to Foundation archives (though they still need to be added to Special Access Programs, and do not have the "blanket" access that O5s do). Some of the O5's personal staff and secretaries are among the [[[The Seed of an Idea| most powerful people]]] in the Foundation.

O5 Council members sometimes fixate on [[[deals-with-the-devil| certain Foundation researchers]]]. Many of the most well-known Foundation doctors and agents have been under the eye of one or more O5 members, willingly or not. This does not always end well for those favored in this way.

-----------

**Factotum**

[[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army| According to some reports]]], the personal staff of the O5 Council are known as the Factotum. These Foundation operatives are selected for absolute loyalty, and act as personal assistants, bodyguards and decoys. Many encounters with an "O5" are actually mediated by a Factotum, dressed and disguised to perfectly resemble their assigned Council Member.

Reports ascribe some of these staff certain anomalous abilities, and the O5 Command reportedly approves this anomalous alteration to allow them to act as better decoys or bodyguards, directly circumventing official Foundation procedure. This makes it almost impossible to tell a decoy apart from the real thing.

Of course, if they want to mislead, there's no reason to make this a perfect resemblance. For all we know, every one of the O5s described in this dossier are mere decoys, and the real O5 Council remains unknown.

-----------

**Delegation**

Although O5 Command holds tightly to its power over the Foundation, they do delegate many tasks. The exact command structure of the Foundation is unclear, but references have been made to the body known variously as the [[[djkaktus-s-proposal-iii| Site Directors’ Council]]], the [[[kate-mctiriss-s-proposal| Site Directors' Executive Committee of the Whole]]] or the [[[o4-s-summit| O4 Council]]] (not to be confused with the O4 Command in charge of [[[lockdown-procedures| Lockdown Procedures]]]). This organisation is assembled for matters requiring a broader perspective, or considered too minor for the O5 Council yet too significant or far reaching for any individual to decide. Under [[[slate-thunder| certain circumstances]]], this body may even have the power to depose and appoint O5 Council members, and it seems designed to ensure that the Foundation can continue functioning in the event that anything happens to the O5 Council.  

[https://scp-int.wikidot.com/ Regional branches] of the SCP Foundation have their own equivalent bodies with full clearance for all anomalies under their regional jurisdiction, acting as an O5 equivalent for most intents and purposes, although still subordinate to the O5 Council. This includes the [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-foundation-in-deutschland-portal German Directors Council] (known as the O4 Council), the [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/organizzazione-interna Superintendence of the Italian Branch] (The S5), and the [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/organograma-lusofona Lusophone Board of Directors] (The CL5).

[[tab Further Intel]]

**Further Intelligence On O5 Command**

Appointing new O5s is rare to the point of being legendary, at least publicly. Rumors persist -- potentially true -- that some or all of the O5 Council members are inhuman or possess supernatural powers. Rumors also persist that they are unkillable, but this is at least partially untrue, given that several are known to be deceased.

As far as I can tell (and I may be wrong), all O5 Council members are human in origin, even if altered after the fact. A minority of the O5 Council may have anomalous abilities or traits, if reports are to be believed (in particular reports on O5-1 and O5-2), but none of the O5 Council are reality benders, and most of them are simply human... but humans with access to the [[[SCP-006|Water of Life]]], and power beyond imagining. Far, far, far too much power.

The O5s rarely intervene in the day-to-day processes of the Foundation, or the containment of SCP objects. They tend to keep an eye on Keter-Class objects, and practically micromanage Thaumiels and Apollyons.

But sometimes -- rarely -- they'll jump into an apparently random Euclid- or Safe-Class object's documentation, and make some summary judgment with or without explanation. After all, no explanation is required of them.

O5 Council members are officially barred from coming into contact with any anomalous entities. This is, naturally, not strictly true in practice. At minimum, all O5 Council members of sufficient tenure have access to [[[SCP-006]]], a "fountain of youth", and likely to [[[SCP-2718|other means]]] of [[[SCP-4470| prolonging their lifespan]]] as well. And that aside, O5s tend to be able to [[[scp-910| bend rules]]], even their own rules.

-------------

Some reports suggest that O5s regularly switch numbers with each other, either ad hoc or on a standardized basis. They make common use of body doubles and other security and disinformation techniques.

The Meeting Place of the O5 Council is frequently referred to as [[[secure-facilities-locations|Protected Site]]][[[scp-5105| -001]]], and one or more O5 Council Members may reside there most or all of the time. Alternative reports have described this headquarters as [[[spikebrennan-s-proposal| Building T-01]]] or [[[djkaktus-s-proposal-iii| O5 Command]]] instead. Some reports claim that at least one O5 is in space at all times.

[[[ecceperago| One particularly interesting report]]] indicates that O5 Command members all wear an article of clothing and/or fetish object as a symbol of their office, with this totem being [[[annon| passed on to their successors]]]. Possibly fashioned from the corpse of the most powerful reality bender to ever live, each object can completely stabilize reality around an O5 member. (Unclear how long this lasts, or if it is a permanent low-level effect.) Also said to grant additional abilities; precisely what these are remains unclear, as does the truth of this report.

[[[scp-321| Another]]] [[[scp-590| set]]] [[[codebrown| of]]] [[[scp-5935| reports]]] claim that a number of humanoid SCPs are family members of O5 Council members. It is possible that fictional anomalous documentation was drawn up for them to justify keeping them under the best protection possible. There are also claims that some O5s have gone as far as to actually anomalously alter their family members to permanently justify Foundation protection via containment.

The O5 Council appears to choose their own members should a seat become vacant, although under [[[slate-thunder| certain circumstances]]] they may become accountable to the Senior staff of the Foundation.

The exact [[[scp-5549| relationship between]]] O5 Command and the Foundation's [[[ethics-committee-orientation| Ethics Committee]]] is unclear. I used to think that the Committee either didn't exist or just [[[scp-5973| rubber-stamped]]] the Council's decisions, but some reports suggest that the Ethics Committee has the power to [[[scp-5549| overrule]]] or even [[[Tanhony's Proposal| depose]]] the Council. Who's really in charge here?

There are a few reports of an [[[SCP-6500| unofficial "O5-0"]]], a former associate of the original O5 Council Members who left the Foundation due to ideological differences. Much like the official members of the Overwatch Council, I've encountered multiple contradictory descriptions of this "O5-0" - sorry, that seems to be a trend. They certainly sound like they'd be an interesting person to meet, if I ever get the opportunity...

-------------

One source bears notable mention: the reports, sources, and personas collectively referred to as [[[djkaktus's Proposal III| "The Swallowed Tail"]]]. Please be warned before looking into this report: we acquired access to this documentation through the heart of the [[[chaos-insurgency-hub| Chaos Insurgency]]], and they seem to have gotten most of their intel from a journal written by a [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition]]] agent that later defected to the Foundation. If you're unfamiliar with the risks of Insurgency dealings, avoid looking at this, if you value your own life.

We initially thought this report to be Foundation disinformation (perhaps even targeted at me/us, the creator/creators of this dossier), but when we became aware of greater context, we realized we could draw zero conclusions.

Is there a multiversal thread issue here that we're not aware of? A disconnection followed by an unknown bridge? An undescribed resonance? Something so obvious, too close to ourselves that we cannot see it? Something Outside, and dangerous?

I/We really have to look into this.

If you don't know what you're doing, remember this: there are many worlds, and there are as many ends of the world. Some things you're better off not knowing. The number of these things may or may not be zero. Help, or don't.
